  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As I sit down to write this preface there rises before me, not the
other side of this London street, but the beautiful view over the
harbour of St. Vincent, Cape Verde Islands, as seen from the
British Consulate. It was a hot afternoon, but in that shady
room I had found a fellow-woman and sympathetic listener.
To her I had been recounting, rather mercilessly as it seemed,
the story of our experiences in the yacht, including the drowning
of the tea in Las Palmas Harbour. When I had finished, she
said quietly, “You are going to publish all this I suppose?”
I hesitated, for the idea was new. “No,” I replied, “we had
not thought of doing so; of course, if we have any success at
Easter Island we shall make it known, but this is all in the day’s
work.” “I think,” she said, “that there are many who lead
quiet stay-at-home lives who would be interested.” Times
have changed since 1913, there are now few who have not had
adventures, either in their own persons, or through those dear
to them, compared with which ours were but pleasant play;
but I still find that many of those who are good enough to care
to hear what we did in those three years ask for personal details.
After a lecture given to a learned society, which it had been an
honour to be asked to address, I was accosted by a lady, invited
for the occasion, with the remark, “I was disappointed in what
you told us. You never said what you had to eat.” This, and
many similar experiences, are the apology for the trivialities of
this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>No attempt has been made to write any sort of a guide book
to the varied places touched at by the yacht, neither space nor
knowledge permitted; all that has been done either by pen
or pencil is to try to give the main impression left on the mind
of a passing dweller in their harbours and anchorages. It has,
however, been found by experience that, in accounts of travel,
the general reader loses much of the pleasure which has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>experienced by the writer, through knowledge being assumed
of the history of the places visited; a knowledge which the
traveller himself has absorbed almost unconsciously. Without
some acquaintance with past events the present cannot be
understood; at the risk, therefore, of interrupting the narrative,
a few notes of such history have been included.</p>

<p class='c007'>In dealing with the main topic of the work, an endeavour has
been made to give some idea of the problem of Easter Island as
the Expedition found it, and also of its work there. With regard
to this part, some appeal is necessary to the understanding kindness
of the reader, for it has not been an easy tale to tell, nor one
which could be straightforwardly recounted. The story of
Easter is as yet a tangled skein. The dim past, to which the
megalithic works bear witness—the island as the early voyagers
found it—its more recent history and present state, all of these
are intermingled threads, none of which can be followed without
reference to the remaining clues.</p>

<p class='c007'>For those who would have preferred more scientific and fewer
personal details, I can only humbly say wait, there is another
volume in prospect with descriptions and dimensions of some
two hundred and sixty burial-places on the island, thousands of
measurements of statues, and other really absorbing matter.
The numerical statements in the present book, dealing with
archæological remains, must be considered approximate till it
has been possible to go again through the large collection of notes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is fairly obvious why the writing of this story has fallen to
the share of the sole feminine member of the Expedition. I had
also, what was, in spite of all things, the good fortune to be
fourteen weeks longer on the island than my husband. They
were fat weeks too, when the first lean ones, with their inevitable
difficulties, were past; and the unsettlement towards the end
had not arrived. He has, I need hardly say, given me every
assistance with this work. Generally speaking, all things which
it is possible to touch and handle, buildings, weapons, and ornaments,
were in his department; while things of a less tangible
description, such as religion, history, and folk lore fell to my lot.
Those who know him will recognise his touches throughout, and
the account of the last part of the voyage, after my return to
England, has been written by him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The photographs, when not otherwise stated, are by members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>of the Expedition. The drawings are from sketches made by
the Author; those of the burial-places are from note-book outlines
made in the course of work. The diagrams of the houses and
burial-places are by my husband.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are deeply grateful, both personally and on behalf of the
Expedition, for all the aid, both public and private, extended to
our work in the interests of science. We hesitate to allude to it
in detail in connection with what may, it is to be feared, seem
an unworthy book, but we cannot refrain from taking this, the
earliest, opportunity of acknowledging our obligations. The
Admiralty lent the Expedition a Lieutenant on full pay for
navigation and survey. The Royal Society honoured it by
bestowing a grant of £100, and the British Association by appointing
a committee to further its interests accompanied by a
small gift. Valuable scientific instruments were lent by both
the Admiralty and Royal Geographical Society.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are indebted to Sir Hercules Read and Captain T. A.
Joyce, of the Ethnological Department of the British Museum,
for the initial suggestion and much personal help. In our own
University of Oxford the practical sympathy of Dr. Marett has
been fully given from the time the project was first mooted till
he read the proofs of the scientific part of this work; we owe
more to such encouragement for any success attained than
perhaps he himself realises. Mr. Henry Balfour has placed us,
and all who are interested in the subject, under the greatest
obligation for his work on our results which has thrown a flood
of light on the culture of Easter Island, and has, in perhaps
greater degree than anything else, made the Expedition seem
“worth while.” Dr. Rivers, of Cambridge, kindly undertook
the position of Correspondent in connection with the committee
of the British Association, and has put at our disposal
his great knowledge of the Pacific. Dr. Haddon has also been
good enough to allow us to avail ourselves of his intimate
acquaintance with its problems. Dr. Corney has rendered
constant and unique assistance with regard to the accounts of
Easter Island as given by the early voyagers, a line of research
most important in its bearings. Our thanks are due to Dr.
Seligman for kind interest, to Professor Keith for his report
on the two Pitcairn Islanders who returned with the yacht,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>and his examination of our osteological collection; to Dr.
Thomas of the Geological Survey for his report of the rocks
brought back; and not least to Mr. Sydney Ray, who has given
most valuable time to our vocabularies of the language.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to our journeyings and labours in the field, we are
under great obligation to Mr. Edwards, the Chilean Minister in
London, through whose representations his Government were
good enough to grant us special facilities in their ports. The
Expedition owes much to Messrs. Balfour &#38; Williamson of
London, and the firms connected with them in Chile, California,
and New York; most especially to Messrs. Williamson &#38; Balfour
of Valparaiso for their permission to visit Easter Island and help
throughout. We are also very grateful to the manager of the
ranch, Mr. Percy Edmunds, for his practical aid on the island;
since we left he has obtained for us a skin of the sacred bird
which we had been unable to procure, and forwarded with it
the negative of fig. 65, taken at our request.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been impossible in the compass of this book to express
our gratitude to all those who gave help and hospitality on both
the outward and homeward voyage. We can only ask them to
believe that we do not forget, and that the friendship of many

<p class='c007'>For professional help in the production of this book it is a
pleasure to acknowledge the skill and patience of Miss A. Hunter,
who has assisted in preparing the sketches, and of Mr. Gear,
President of the Royal Photographic Society, who has worked
up the negatives; also of Mr. F. Batchelor, of the Royal Geographical
Society, who has drawn all the maps.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has not, as will be readily understood, been always an easy
matter to write of such different interests amidst the urgent
claims and stupendous events since the time of our return; but
if any soul rendered sad by the war, or anxiously facing the problems
of a new world, finds a few hours’ rest surrounded by the
blue of the sea or face to face with the everlasting calm of the
great statues, then it will give very real happiness to</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The second edition of a book affords opportunity to tender grateful
thanks for the interest which has made it necessary. It is
also one of the occasions when fate allows, in some measure at
any rate, a chance to repair shortcomings.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was felt in writing this volume that it was best to leave
the work of the Expedition to tell as far as possible its own
tale. Life, however, is short and books are many. Outside the
circle of those with special scientific knowledge, this method
seems, in spite of Chapter XIX, to have led too often, with
even the kindest of readers and reviewers, to a certain vagueness
as to what has, after all, really been accomplished. Some express
disappointment that the problem is “unsolved if not insoluble”;
others state, not without lingering regret, that “there is no
longer any mystery.” Neither view is, of course, correct. It is,
therefore, perhaps worth while, even at the cost of repeating
what may be implicit elsewhere, to add a few more definite
words.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was never anticipated that any Expedition could settle once
and for all the past history of Easter Island. In dealing with
any scientific problem, the first step naturally is to find out all
that can be discovered about the material in question; while
the second is to co-ordinate that material with similar examples
elsewhere, so that knowledge which may fail from one source,
can be supplied from another.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Expedition, therefore, as one of its primary undertakings,
made an archæological survey of the island. It was a lengthy
work, for not only are the figures and ruins very numerous,
but it was found that not till after some six months’ study could
they even be seen with intelligent eyes. We believe the survey
to be, however, as far as possible accurate and complete. It is
illustrated by some hundreds of sketches and negatives.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only account of this kind which has so far been available
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>is the rough, and naturally often erroneous, description given
by the United States ship <em>Mohican</em> after a thirteen days’ examination
in 1886. Speaking of this part of our labours, a high
authority has been good enough to say, “We now know for
the first time in what the remains on the island really consist;
its photographs alone would justify the Expedition.” This
record will, we venture to think, hold increased value in the
future, as there is a constant tendency for the remains to suffer
deterioration at the hands of nature and man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Expedition, however, found other and unexpected matter
to secure from oblivion—work which was of even greater, because
of more pressing, importance. We had been informed that not
only had all knowledge of the origin of the great works disappeared
from the island, but that all memory of the early
native culture before the advent of Christianity, which might
possibly have thrown light upon them, was also gone. Happily
this proved to be not altogether the case. When we arrived,
such knowledge and tradition were expiring, but they were not
altogether dead. It was our good fortune, in spite of language
and other difficulties, to be able with patience to rescue at the
eleventh hour much of high value, more especially that which
points to a connection between the only recently expired bird
cult and that of the images.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts now before us make clear that the present inhabitants
of the island are derived from a union of the two great stocks
of the Pacific, the Melanesian and Polynesian races, and that the
Melanesian element has played a large part in its development.
All the evidence gathered, whether derived from the stone remains,
through the surviving natives, or in other ways, points to the
conclusion that these people are connected by blood with the
makers of the statues; this is, of course, the crucial point.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that this stage is reached, the problem at once falls into
its right category; and we enter on the second phase of scientific
quest. Easter Island is no longer an isolated mystery, there is
no need to indulge in surmises as to sunken continents, it becomes
part of the whole question of the culture of the Pacific and of
the successive waves of migration which have passed through it.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this large and difficult subject many able minds are at
work, and some striking results, already drawn from the labours
of the Expedition, are included in this volume. When we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>more definite knowledge as to the nature and date of these migrations
which have come from the west by such stepping-stones
as Pitcairn Island, or by the Marquesas and Paumotu groups,
then we shall be able to deduce still further information about
Easter Island. When more is ascertained of the stone works
scattered throughout other islands, we shall speak with greater
certainty as to whether a first or second wave of immigrants, or
both combined, are responsible for its monoliths. We have
a very fair idea now, when, and perhaps why, the cult of the
statues ended; even if there are no further discoveries on the
island, we hope in these ways to learn when and how it began.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is much we shall never know—the thoughts which
passed through the minds of those old image-makers as they
worked at their craft, the scenes enacted as their humbler neighbours
toilsomely moved the great figures to their place, the
weird ceremonies which doubtless marked their erection, not
least the story of the persistence which erected and re-erected
the burying-places after again and yet again they had been
destroyed—such things are gone for ever. But the broad outlines
and events of the story, with their approximate dates, to
these there is every prospect we shall attain with reasonable
certainty, and that before very many years have elapsed.</p>

    <div>Why we went to Easter Island—The Building and Equipping of the Yacht—The Start from Southampton—Dartmouth—Falmouth.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“All the seashore is lined with numbers of stone idols, with
their backs turned towards the sea, which caused us no little
wonder, because we saw no tool of any kind for working these
figures.” So wrote, a century and a half ago, one of the earliest
navigators to visit the Island of Easter in the South-east
Pacific. Ever since that day passing ships have found it incomprehensible
that a few hundred natives should have been
able to make, move, and erect numbers of great stone monuments,
some of which are over thirty feet in height; they have
marvelled and passed on. As the world’s traffic has increased
Easter Island has still stood outside its routes, quiet and remote,
with its story undeciphered. What were these statues
of which the present inhabitants know nothing? Were they
made by their ancestors in forgotten times or by an earlier
race? Whence came the people who reached this remote
spot? Did they arrive from South America, 2,000 miles to the
eastward? Or did they sail against the prevailing wind from the
distant islands to the west? It has even been conjectured
that Easter Island is all that remains of a sunken continent.
Fifty years ago the problem was increased by the discovery on
this mysterious land of wooden tablets bearing an unknown
script; they too have refused to yield their secret.</p>

<p class='c007'>When, therefore, we decided to see the Pacific before we
died, and asked the anthropological authorities at the British
Museum what work there remained to be done, the answer
was, “Easter Island.” It was a much larger undertaking than
had been contemplated; we had doubts of our capacity for so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>important a venture; and at first the decision was against it,
but we hesitated and were lost. Then followed the problem
how to reach the goal. The island belongs to Chile, and the
only regular communication, if regular it can be called, was
a small sailing vessel sent out by the Chilean Company, who
use the island as a ranch; she went sometimes once a year,
sometimes not so often, and only remained there sufficient time
to bring off the wool crop. We felt that the work on Easter
ought to be accompanied with the possibility of following up
clues elsewhere in the islands, and that to charter any such
vessel as could be obtained on the Pacific coast, for the length
of time we required her, would be unsatisfactory, both from
the pecuniary standpoint and from that of comfort. It was
therefore decided, as Scoresby is a keen yachtsman, that it
was worth while to procure in England a little ship of our
own, adapted to the purpose, and to sail out in her. As the
Panama Canal was not open, and the route by Suez would be
longer, the way would lie through the Magellan Straits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Search for a suitable vessel in England was fruitless, and it
became clear that to get what we wanted we must build. The
question of general size and arrangement had first to be settled,
and then matters of detail. It is unfortunate that the precise
knowledge which was acquired of the exact number of inches
necessary to sleep on, to sit on, and to walk along is not again
likely to be useful. The winter of 1910–11 was spent over
this work, but the professional assistance obtained proved to
be incompetent, and we had to begin again; the final architect
of the little yacht was Mr. Charles Nicholson, of Gosport, and
the plans were completed the following summer. They were
for a vessel of schooner rig and auxiliary motor power. The
length over all was 90 feet, and the water-line 72 feet; her
beam was 20 feet. The gross tonnage was 91 and the yacht
tonnage was 126.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vessel was designed in four compartments, with a steel
bulkhead between each of the divisions, so that in case of
accident it would be possible to keep her afloat. Aft was the
little chart-room, which was the pride of the ship. When we
went on board magnificent yachts which could have carried
our little vessel as a lifeboat, and found the navigation being
done in the public rooms, we smiled with superiority. Out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the chart-room were the navigator’s sleeping quarters, and in
the overhang of the stern the sail-locker. The next compartment
was given to the engines, and made into a galvanised
iron box in case of fire. It contained a motor engine for such
work as navigation in and out of harbour and traversing belts
of calm. This was of 38 h.p. and run on paraffin, as petrol was
disallowed by the insurance; it gave her 5½ knots. In the
same compartment was the engine for the electric light: in
addition the yacht had steam heating. The spaces between
the walls of the engine-box and those of the ship were given
to lamps, and to boatswain’s stores.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came the centre of the ship, containing the quarters
of our scientific party. The middle portion of this was raised
three or four feet for the whole length, securing first a deck-house
and then a heightened roof for the saloon below, an
arrangement which was particularly advantageous, as no port-holes
were allowed below decks, leaving us dependent on skylights
and ventilators. Entering from without, two or three
steps led down into the deck-house, which formed part of the
saloon, but at a higher level; it was my chief resort throughout
the voyage. On each side was a settee, which was on the level
of the deck, and thus commanded a view through port-holes
and door of what was passing outside; one of these settees
served as a berth in hot weather. A small companion connected
the deck-house with the saloon below: the latter ran across the
width of the ship; it also had full-length settees both sides, and
at the end of each was a chiffonier. On the port side was the
dinner-table, which swung so beautifully that the fiddles were
seldom used, and the thermos for the navigating officer could
be left happily on it all night. Starboard was a smaller table,
fitted for writing; and a long bookshelf ran along the top of the
for’ardside (fig. 1<sup>A</sup>).</p>

<p class='c007'>On the afterside of the saloon a double cabin opened out of
it, and a passage led to two single cabins and the bathroom.
The cabins were rather larger than the ordinary staterooms of
a mail steamer, and the arrangements of course more ample;
every available cranny was utilised for drawers and lockers,
and in going ashore it was positive pain to see the waste of
room under beds and sofas and behind washing-stands. My
personal accommodation was a chest of drawers and hanging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>wardrobe, besides the drawers under the berth and various
lockers. Returning to the saloon, a door for’ard opened into
the pantry, which communicated with the galley above, situated
on deck for the sake of coolness. For’ard again was a whole
section given to stores, and beyond, in the bows, a roomy forecastle.
The yacht had three boats—a lifeboat which contained
a small motor engine, a cutter, and a dinghy; when we were at sea
the two former were placed on deck, but the dinghy, except on
one occasion only, was always carried in the davits, where she
triumphantly survived all eventualities, a visible witness to the
buoyancy of the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the plans were being completed, search was being
made for a place where the vessel should be built; for though
nominally a yacht, the finish and build of the Solent would
have been out of place. It had been decided that she should
be of wood, as easier to repair in case of accident where coral
reefs and other unseen dangers abound; but the building of
wooden ships is nearly extinct. The west country was visited,
and an expedition made to Dundee and Aberdeen, but even
there, the old home of whalers, ships are now built of steel;
finally we fixed on Whitstable, from which place such vessels
still ply round the coast. The keel was laid in the autumn
of 1911; the following spring we took up our abode there to
watch over her, and there in May 1912 she first took the water,
being christened by the writer in approved fashion. “I name
this ship <em>Mana</em>, and may the blessing of God go with her and
all who sail in her”—a ceremony not to be performed without
a lump in the throat. The choice of a name had been difficult;
we had wished to give her one borne by some ship of Dr.
Scoresby, the Arctic explorer, a friend of my husband’s family
whose name he received, but none of them proved to be suitable.
The object was to find something which was both simple
and uncommon; all appellations that were easy to grasp seemed
to have been already adopted, while those that were unique
lent themselves to error. “How would it do in a cable?” was
the regulation test. Finally we hit on <em>Mana</em>, which is a word
well known to anthropologists, and has the advantage of being
familiar throughout the South Seas. We generally translated
it somewhat freely as “good luck.” It means, more strictly,
supernatural power: a Polynesian would, for instance, describe
the common idea of the effect of a horseshoe by saying that
the shoe had “mana.” From a scientific standpoint mana is
probably the simplest form of religious conception. The yacht
flew the burgee of the Royal Cruising Club.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>From the time the prospective expedition became public
we received a considerable amount of correspondence from
strangers: some of it was from those who had special knowledge
of the subject, and was highly valued; other letters had a comic
element, being from various young men, who appeared to think
that our few berths might be at the disposal of anyone who
wanted to see the world. One letter, dated from a newspaper
office, stated that its writer had no scientific attainments, but
would be glad to get up any subject required in the time before
sailing; the qualification of another for the post of steward
was that he would be able to print the menus and ball programmes.
The most quaint experience was in connection with
a correspondent who gave a good name and address, and offered
to put at our disposal some special knowledge on the subject
of native lore, which he had collected as Governor of one of
the South Sea islands. On learning our country address, he
wrote that he was about to become the guest of some of our
neighbours and would call upon us. It subsequently transpired
that they knew nothing of him, but that he had written to them,
giving our name. He did, in fact, turn up at our cottage during
our absence, and obtained an excellent tea at the expense of
the caretaker. The next we heard of him was from the keeper
of a small hotel in the neighbourhood of Whitstable, where he
had run up a large bill on the strength of a statement that he
was one of our expedition, and we found later that he had
shown a friend over the yacht while she was building, giving
out he was a partner of my husband. We understand that
after we started he appeared in the county court at the instance
of the unfortunate innkeeper.</p>

<p class='c007'>After much trouble we ultimately selected two colleagues
from the older universities. The arrangement with one of
these, an anthropologist, was, unfortunately, a failure, and ended
at the Cape Verde Islands. The other, a geologist, Mr. Frederick
Lowry-Corry, took up intermediate work in India, and subsequently
joined us in South America. The Admiralty was good
enough to place at our disposal a lieutenant on full pay for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>navigation, survey, and tidal observation. This post was
ultimately filled by Lieutenant D. R. Ritchie, R.N.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the important matter of the crew, it was felt
that neither merchant seamen nor yacht hands would be suitable,
and a number of men were chosen from the Lowestoft
fishing fleet. Subsequent delays, however, proved deleterious,
the prospective “dangers” grew in size, and the only one who
ultimately sailed with us was a boy, Charles C. Jeffery, who
was throughout a loyal and valued member of the expedition.
The places of the other men were supplied by a similar class
from Brixham, who justified the selection. The mate, Preston,
gave much valuable service, and one burly seaman in particular,
Light by name, by his good humour and intelligent
criticism added largely to the amenity of the voyage. An
engineer, who was also a photographer, was obtained from
Glasgow. We were particularly fortunate in our sailing master,
Mr. H. J. Gillam. He had seen, while in Japan, a notice of the
expedition in a paper, and applied with keenness for the post;
to his professional knowledge, loyalty, and pleasant companionship
the successful achievement of the voyage is very largely
due. The full complement of the yacht, in addition to the
scientific members, consisted of the navigator, engineer, cook-steward,
under-steward, and three men for each watch, making
ten in all. S. was official master, and I received on the books
the by no means honorary rank of stewardess.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whitstable proved to be an unsuitable place for painting,
so <em>Mana</em> made her first voyage round to Southampton Water,
where she lay for a while in the Hamble River, and later at a
yacht-builder’s in Southampton. The steward on this trip
took to his bed with seasickness; but as he was subsequently
found surreptitiously eating the dinner which S. had been obliged
to cook, we felt that he was not likely to prove a desirable
shipmate, and he did not proceed further. We had hoped to
sail in the autumn, but we had our full share of the troubles
and delays which seem inevitably associated with yacht-building:
the engine was months late in the installation, and then
had to be rectified; the painting took twice as long as had been
promised; and when we put out for trial trips there was trouble
with the anchor which necessitated a return to harbour. The
friends who had kindly assembled in July at the Hans Crescent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Hotel to bid us good speed began to ask if we were ever really
going to depart. We spent the winter practically living on
board, attending to these affairs and to the complicated matter
of stowage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general question of space had of course been very carefully
considered in the original designs. The allowance for
water was unusually large, the tanks containing sufficient for
two, or with strict economy for three months; the object in
this was not only safety in long or delayed passages, but to
avoid taking in supplies in doubtful harbours. Portions of the
hold had to be reserved of course for coal, and also for the
welded steel tanks which contained the oil. When these
essentials had been disposed of, still more intricate questions
arose with regard to the allotment of room; it turned out to be
greater than we had ventured to hope, but this in no way helped,
as every department hastened to claim additional accommodation
and to add something more to its stock. Nothing was
more surprising all through the voyage than the yacht’s elasticity:
however much we took on board we got everything in,
and however much we took out she was always quite full.</p>

<p class='c007'>The outfit for the ship had of course been taken into consideration,
but as departure drew near it seemed, from the
standpoint of below decks, to surpass all reason; there were
sails for fine weather and sails for stormy weather, and spare
sails, anchors, and sea-anchors, one-third of a mile of cable, and
ropes of every size and description.</p>

<p class='c007'>As commissariat officer, the Stewardess naturally felt that
domestic stores were of the first importance. Many and intricate
calculations had been made as to the amount a man ate
in a month, and the cubic space to be allowed for the same. It
had been also a study in itself to find out what must come from
England and what could be obtained elsewhere; kind correspondents
in Buenos Aires and Valparaiso had helped with
advice, and we arranged for fresh consignments from home to
meet us in those ports, of such articles as were not to be
procured there or were inordinately expensive. The general
amount of provisions on board was calculated for six months,
but smaller articles, such as tea, were taken in sufficient quantities
for the two years which it was at the time assumed would
be the duration of the trip. We brought back on our return a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>considerable amount of biscuits, for it was found possible to
bake on board much oftener than we had dared to hope. As
a yacht we were not obliged to conform to the merchant service
scale of provisions, our ship’s articles guaranteeing “sufficiency
and no waste.” The merchant scale was constantly referred
to, but it is, by universal agreement, excessive, and leads to
much waste, as the men are liable to claim what they consider
their right, whether they consume the ration or not; the result
is that a harbour may not unfrequently be seen covered with
floating pieces of bread, or even whole loaves. The quantity
asked for by our men of any staple foods was always given,
and there were the usual additions, but we subsisted on about
three-fourths of the legal ration. We had only one case of
illness requiring a doctor, and then it was diagnosed as “the
result of over-eating.” It was a source of satisfaction that we
never throughout the voyage ran short of any essential commodity.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were other matters in the household department for
which it was even more difficult to estimate than for the
actual food—how many cups and saucers, for example, should
we break per month, and how many reams of paper and quarts
of ink ought we to take. Our books had of course to be
largely scientific, a sovereign’s worth of cheap novels was a
boon, but we often yearned unutterably for a new book. Will
those who have friends at the ends of the earth remember the
godsend to them of a few shillings so invested, as a means of
bringing fresh thoughts and a sense of civilised companionship?
For a library for the crew we were greatly indebted to the
kindness of Lord Radstock and the Passmore Edwards Ocean
Library. We were subsequently met at every available port
by a supply of newspapers, comprising the weekly editions of
the <cite>Times</cite> and <cite>Daily Graphic</cite>, the <cite>Spectator</cite>; and the papers of
two Societies for Women’s Suffrage.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the requirements for the voyage the whole
equipment for landing had to be foreseen and stowed, comprising
such things as tents, saddlery, beds, buckets, basins, and
cooking-pots. We later regretted the space given to some of
the enamelled iron utensils, as they can be quite well procured
in Chile, while cotton and other goods which we had counted
on procuring there for barter were practically unobtainable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Some sacks of old clothes which we took out for gifts proved
most valuable. Among late arrivals that clamoured for
peculiar consideration were the scientific outfits, which attained
to gigantic proportions. S., who had studied at one time at
University College Hospital, was our doctor, and the medical
and surgical stores were imposing: judging from the quantity
of bandages, we were each relied on to break a leg once a month.
Everybody had photographic gear; the geologist appeared with
a huge pestle and other goods; there was anthropological
material for the preserving of skulls; the surveying instruments
looked as if they would require a ship to themselves; while
cases of alarming size arrived from the Admiralty and Royal
Geographical Society, containing sounding machines and other
mysterious articles. The owners of all these treasures argued
earnestly that they were of the essence of the expedition, and
must be treated with respect accordingly. Then of course
things turned up for which everyone had forgotten to allow room,
such as spare electric lamps, also a trammel and seine, each of
fifty fathoms, to secure fish in port. Before we finally sailed a
large consignment appeared of bonded tobacco for the crew,
and the principal hold was sealed by the Customs, necessitating
a temporary sacrifice of the bathroom for last articles.</p>

<p class='c007'>This packing of course all took time, especially as nothing
could be allowed to get wet, and a rainy or stormy day hung
up all operations. Finally, however, on the afternoon of
February 28th, 1913, the anchor was weighed, and we went
down Southampton Water under power. We were at last off for
Easter Island!</p>

<p class='c007'>We had a good passage down the Channel, stopped awhile
at Dartmouth, for the Brixham men to say good-bye to their
families, and arrived at Falmouth on March 6th. Here there
was experienced a tiresome delay of nearly three weeks. The wind,
which in March might surely have seen its way to be easterly,
and had long been from that direction, turned round and blew
a strong gale from the south-west. The harbour was white
with little waves, and crowded with shipping of every description,
from battleships to fishing craft. Occasionally a vessel
would venture out to try to get round the Lizard, only to
return beaten by the weather. We had while waiting the sad
privilege of rendering a last tribute to our friend Dr. Thomas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Hodgkin, the author of <cite>Italy and her Invaders</cite>, who just before
our arrival had passed where “tempests cease and surges swell
no more.” He rests among his own people in the quiet little
Quaker burial-ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not till Lady Day, Tuesday, March 25th, that the
wind changed sufficiently to allow of departure; then there
was a last rush on shore to obtain sailing supplies of fresh meat,
fruit, and vegetables, and to send off good-bye telegrams.
Everything was triumphantly squeezed in somewhere and
carefully secured, so that nothing should shift when the roll
began. The only articles which found no home were two sacks
of potatoes, which had to remain on the cabin floor, because the
space assigned to them below hatches had, in my absence on
shore, been nefariously appropriated by the Sailing-master for
an additional supply of coal.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was dark before all was ready, and we left Falmouth
Harbour with the motor; then out into the ocean, the sails
hoisted, the Lizard Light sighted, and good-bye to England!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two years,” said our friends, “that is a long time to be
away.” “Oh no,” we had replied; “we shall find when we
come back that everything is just the same; it always is. You
will still be talking of Militants, and Labour Troubles, and Home
Rule; there will be a few new books to read, the children
will be a little taller—that will be all.” But the result was
otherwise.</p>

    <div>A Gale at Sea—Madeira—Canary Islands—Cape Verde Islands—Across the Atlantic.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The first day in open ocean was spent in shaking down; on
going on deck before turning in it was found to be a clear
starlight night, and the man at the wheel prophesied smooth
things. It was a case of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A little ship was on the sea,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It was a pretty sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>It sailed along so pleasantly,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And all was calm and bright.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But, alas! the storm did soon begin to rise; by morning we
were in troubled waters, and by noon we were battened down
and hove to. We had given up all idea of making progress
and were riding out the gale as best we might. All the saloon
party were more or less laid low, including Mr. Ritchie, for the
first time in his life. The steward was not seen for two days;
and if it had not been that the under-steward, who shall be
known as “Luke,” rose to the occasion, the state of affairs
would have been somewhat serious. He not only contrived to
satisfy the appetites of the crew, which were subsequently said
to have been abnormally good, but also staggered round, with
black hands and a tousled head, ministering with tea and bovril
to our frailer needs. The engineer, a landsman, was too incapacitated
to do any work, and doubt arose as to whether
we should not be left without electric light. More alarming
was the fact that the place smelt badly of paraffin, arousing
anxiety as to the effect the excessive rolling of the ship might
have had on our carefully tested tanks and barrels; happily
the odour proved to be due merely to a temporary overflow in
the engine-room.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>We now found the disadvantage of having abandoned, owing
to our various delays, the trial runs in home waters which
had at one time been planned. The skylights, which would
have been adequate for ordinary yachting—which has been
described as “going round and round the Isle of Wight”—proved
unequal to the work expected of <em>Mana</em>, and the truth appeared
of a dark saying of the Board of Trade surveyor that “skylights
were not ventilation.” Not only could they of course
not be raised in bad weather, but those which, like mine, were
arranged to open, admitted the sea to an unpleasant degree;
such an amount of water had to be conveyed by means of dripping
towels into canvas baths that it seemed at one time as if
the Atlantic would be perceptibly emptier. When in the midst
of the gale night fell on the lonely ship the sensation was eerie;
every now and then the persistent rolling, which threw from
side to side of the berth those fortunate enough to be below,
was interrupted by a resounding crash in the darkness as a
big wave broke against the vessel’s side, followed by the rushing
surge and gurgle of the water as it poured in a volume
over the deck above. Then the hubbub entirely ceased, and
for a perceptible time the vessel lay perfectly still in the trough
of the wave, like a human creature dazed by a sudden blow,
after a second or two to begin again her weary tossing. I wondered,
as I lay there, which was the more weird experience,
this night or one spent in camp in East Africa with no palisade,
in a district swarming with lions, and again recalled the
philosophy of one of our Swahili boys. “Frightened? No, he
eats me, he does not eat me; it is all the will of Allah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By morning the worst was over, and it was a comfort to hear
Mr. Gillam singing cheerfully something about “In the Bay
of Biscay O,” a performance he varied with anathemas on the
seasick steward. When I was able to get on deck, the waves
were still descending on us—if not the proverbial mountains;
at any rate hills high, looking as if they must certainly
overwhelm us. It was wonderful to see, what later I took
for granted, how the yacht rose to each, taking it as it were
in her stride. It was reported to have been a “full gale, a
hurricane, as bad as could be, with dangerous cross seas”; but
the little vessel had proved herself a splendid sea-going boat,
and “had ridden it out like a duck.” For the next little while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>I can only say in the words of the poet, “It was not night, it
was not day”; neither the clothes people wore, nor the food
they took, nor their times of downsitting and uprising had
anything to do with the hours of light and darkness. By
Saturday, however, the weather was better, meals were established,
and things generally more civilised. We had another
bad gale somewhere in the latitude of Finisterre, being hove to
for thirty hours, but were subsequently very little troubled
with seasickness. The second Sunday out, April 6th, we experienced
a short interlude of calm, and I discovered that not
only does a sailing ship not travel in bad weather, but that
when it is really beautifully smooth she also has a bad habit of
declining to go. Anyway, we held our first service, and “O
God, our help” went, if not in Westminster Abbey form, at
any rate quite creditably.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Ritchie had decided to take two sides of a triangle, first
west and then south, rather than run any risk of being blown
on to Ushant or Finisterre; a precaution which, in view of the
proved powers of the boat to hold her own against a head wind,
he subsequently thought to have been unnecessary. After we
left the English shores we only saw two vessels till we were
within sight of Madeira, and some of our Brixham men, who
had never been far from their native shores or away from their
fishing fleet, were much impressed with the size and loneliness
of the ocean. “It was astonishing,” said Light, “that there
could be so much water without any land or ships,” and he
expressed an undisguised desire for “more company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Somehow or other we had all come to the conclusion that we
would put into Madeira, instead of going straight through to
Las Palmas, for which we had cleared from Falmouth. The
first land which we sighted was the outlying island of the
group, Porto Santo. This was appropriate on a voyage to the
New World, as Columbus resided there with his father-in-law,
who was governor of the place; and it is said that from his
observations there of drift-wood, and other indications, he first
conceived the idea of the land across the waters, to which he
made his famous voyage in 1492. Our mate entertained us
with a tale of how he had been shipwrecked on Porto Santo, the
yacht on which he was serving having overrun her reckonings
as she approached it from the west; happily all on board were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>able to escape. The wind fell after we made the group, so that
we did not get into the harbour of Funchal for another thirty-six
hours, and then only with the help of the motor. It was
most enjoyable cruising along the coast of Madeira, watching
the great mountains, woods, ravines, and nestling villages, at
whose existence the passengers on the deck of a Union-Castle
liner can only vaguely guess. The day was Sunday, April 13th,
and later it became a matter of remark how frequently we hit
off this day of the week for getting into harbour, a most inconvenient
one from the point of view of making the necessary
arrangements. As we entered, a Portuguese liner, coming out
of Funchal, dipped its flag in greeting to our blue ensign; out
came the harbour-master’s tug to show us where to take up
our position, down went the anchor with a comfortable rattle,
and so ended the first stage of our journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>The voyage had taken eighteen days, and averaged about
sixty miles a day, as against the hundred miles on which we
had calculated, and which later we sometimes exceeded. A man
who crosses the ocean in a powerful steam-vessel, as one who
travels by land in an express train, undoubtedly gains in speed,
but he loses much else. He misses a thousand beauties, he has
no contact with Nature, no sense of the exultation which comes
from progress won step by step by putting forth his own
powers to bend hers to his will. The late veteran seaman Lord
Brassey is reported to have said that “when once an engine
is put into a ship the charm of the sea is gone.” All through
our voyage also there was a fascinating sense of having put
back the hands of time. This was the route and these in the
main the conditions under which our ancestors, the early Empire
builders, travelled to India; later we were on the track of Drake,
Anson, and others. Some of Drake’s ships were apparently
about the size of <em>Mana</em>.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The world has been shrinking of late,
and to return to a simpler day is to restore much of its size
and dignity.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>MADEIRA</h4>

<p class='c018'>Madeira was settled by the Portuguese early in the fifteenth
century. With the exception of an interlude in the Napoleonic wars,
when it was taken by England, it has ever since been a possession
of that country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Funchal, with its sunshine and its smiling houses, is well known
to all travellers to South Africa. The season was just over,
but the weather was still pleasantly cool, and flowers covered
the walls with great masses of colour. We were there three
days, and occupied our time in the usual way by ascending the
hill above the town in the funicular railway, but instead of
descending in the picturesque toboggans we came down on foot.
The walk took about two hours down a path which is paved the
whole way, representing a very large amount of labour. We
regretted that we were unable to stay longer and see something
of the life in those lonely cottages among the mountains, which
we had seen from the sea, where the women are said to add
considerably to their income by the embroidery for which the
island is famous. Since our visit Funchal, as belonging to
one of the Allies, has suffered in the Great War through enemy
action, having been shelled from the sea and the shipping in
the harbour sunk by a German raid.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>GRAND CANARY</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The Canary group consists of some nine islands, of which the most
important are Teneriffe and Grand Canary. They have been known
from the earliest times, but European sovereignty did not begin till
1402, and it was the end of the century before all the islands became
subject to the crown of Castile. This prolonged warfare was due to
the very brave resistance offered by the original inhabitants, known
as Guanches. These very interesting people, who are of Berber
extraction, withstood the Spaniards till 1483, and the name of Grand
Canary is said to have been obtained from their stubborn defence.
The final defeat of the natives was largely due to the terror inspired
by their first sight of a body of cavalry which the Spaniards had
landed on the island. The Guanches of Teneriffe held out till 1496.
The Canaries were thus subdued just in time to become a stepping-stone
to the New World. The horses of the cavalry were carried to
America, and formed part of the stock from which sprang the wild
American mustang.</p>

<p class='c007'>On quitting Madeira we caught the north-east trade wind
at once, and had a capital run to the Grand Canary, doing the
197 miles in 51½ hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aspect of our new harbour, Puerto de la Luz by name,
was somewhat depressing. On its south side is the mainland
of the island, which consists of sandhills, behind which are
bleak, arid-looking mountains, whose summits during the whole
of our three weeks’ stay were continuously veiled in mist. The
west side is formed by the promontory of Isleta, which would
be an island save that it is connected with Grand Canary by
a sand isthmus washed up by the sea, much after the manner
that Gibraltar is united to the Spanish mainland. The remainder
of the protection for the harbour consists of artificial
breakwaters. The only spot on which the eye rests with pleasure
is a distant view of a cluster of houses, above which rises
a cathedral; this is the capital, Las Palmas, which lies two
or three miles to the south. The effect made on the new-comer,
especially after leaving luxuriant Madeira, is that of
having been transported into the heart of Africa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The port, if not attractive, is at any rate prosperous. The
Canaries are still a stepping-stone to the New World, and in
accordance with modern requirements have turned into a great
coaling station. In Puerto de la Luz six or seven different firms
compete for the work. The British Consul, Major Swanston,
gave us a most interesting account of his duties during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>South African War in revictualling the transports which called
here. Mention should not be omitted of the delightful new
institute of the British and Foreign Sailors’ Society, with
billiard-room, reading-room, and arranged concerts, to which
our men were very glad to resort; but indeed we met similar
kind provision in so many ports that it seems invidious to
particularise.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was my first experience of life in a foreign port as
“stewardess,” for our stay at Madeira was only an interlude.
To passengers on a mail steamer the time so spent is generally
concerned with changing into shore clothes, and making up
parties for dinner on land to avoid the exigencies of coaling.
To those in charge of a small boat its aspect is very different.
Much of it is not a time of leisure, but to be an acting member
of a British ship in a foreign port is distinctly exhilarating.
It brings with it a sense both of being a humble representative
of one’s own nationality, and also of belonging to the
great busy fraternity of the sea. First, as land is approached,
comes the running up of the ensign and burgee; then the making
of the ship’s number, as the signal-station is passed, which will
in due course be reported to Lloyds; next follows the entry
into port, and the awaiting of the harbour-master, on whose
fiat it hangs where the vessel shall take up her berth. He is
succeeded by doctor and customs officer to examine the
ship’s papers; and all these are matters not for some mysterious
personages with gold braid, but of personal interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the yacht is safely berthed the Master goes on
shore to visit the consul, and obtain the longed-for letters and
newspapers. In the food department the important question
of food at once arises. My hope had always been that we
should have found a steward capable of taking over this responsibility,
but though we had various changes, and paid the
highest wages, we were never able to get one sufficiently reliable,
and the work therefore fell on the Stewardess. We at first used
to go on shore and cater personally, which is no doubt the most
satisfactory method, but in view of the time involved we subsequently
relied on the “ships’ chandlers,” who are universal
providers, to be found in all ports of any size, and who will bring
fresh stores to the ship daily. A very careful examination and
comparison of prices is necessary, for one of the annoying parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of owning a boat is that even the smallest yacht-owner is considered
fair game for extortion and dishonest dealing. The
variation in the cost of commodities in different harbours
requires a very elastic mind on the part of the housekeeper,
both as to menus in port and purchases for the next stage of
the voyage. It puts an extremely practical interest into the
list of exports, which formed so dreary a part of geography as
taught in one’s own childhood. At Las Palmas prices were much
as in pre-war England; at our next port, in Cape Verde Islands,
the best meat was sixpence a pound, and fish sufficient for
four cost threepence, but the cost of bread was high. At Rio
de Janeiro and elsewhere in South America, though most things
were ruinous, we obtained enough coffee at very reasonable
prices to carry us home; while in Buenos Aires, with mutton
at fourpence a pound, it was a matter of regret that the hold
was not twice as large.</p>

<p class='c007'>On arriving in port after a long voyage, work is generally
needed on the vessel or her engines: if so, the name of the right
firm has to be obtained, the firm found, an estimate obtained
and bargain made. Then the work has to be done and frequently
redone, all of which causes delay it seems impossible
to avoid; a fortnight may thus easily be spent in getting a
two days’ job accomplished. In Las Palmas we were fortunate
in finding a capable firm, who took in hand such alterations as
our experience in the Bay had shown to be necessary. The
offending skylights were fastened down, and ventilating shafts
substituted, with the result that we had no more trouble. We
had a good deal of extra work on board to do ourselves from
a tiresome mishap. In inspecting the stove connected with
the heating apparatus, it was noticed that there was water under
the grating; this was at first thought to be due to skylight
drip, but on lifting the grating there was seen to be quite deep
water in the hold almost up to the outside sea-level. The
pumps were at once rigged to get it down, but it was found
still to be filling; and it was then discovered that there was a
serious leakage, due to the fact that the pipe through which
the water came to cool the engine had been defectively jointed.
It meant days of work to go through the stores affected.
Happily nothing was lost except about twenty pounds of tea,
and some sweets intended for gifts; but if the accident, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>was entirely due to careless workmanship, had happened at sea
the results might have been disastrous.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were glad when we were at last able to see something
of the country. If the harbour of Luz is not beautiful, the road
from it into Las Palmas is still less so. It runs between the
sea and arid sandhills, and abounds in ruts and dust; as there
is also no street lighting, “the rates,” as S. remarked, “can
hardly be high.” Half-way along this road there stand, for
no very obvious reason, the English Church and Club, also a
good hotel, the Santa Catalina, belonging to a steamship company;
otherwise it is bordered by poor and unattractive houses
of stucco, the inhabitants of which seem permanently seated at
the windows to watch the passers-by. Happily the distance
is traversed by means of trams, owned by a company with
English capital, which run frequently between the port and
the city and do the journey in twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Las Palmas itself is not unpicturesque. Its main feature is a
stony river-bed, which runs down the centre of the city and is
spanned by various bridges; it was empty when we saw it, but
is no doubt at times, even in this waterless land, filled with a
raging, boiling current from the mountains. In the principal
square, opposite the cathedral, is the museum, which contains
an admirable anthropological collection, concerned mostly with
relics of the Guanches. When we were there the city was gay
with bunting and grand stands for a <i><span lang="fr">fiesta</span></i>, in celebration of the
anniversary of the union of the islands with the crown of Castile;
a flying man, a carnival, and an outdoor cinema entertainment
were among the chief excitements. At one of the hotels we
discussed politics with the waiter, who was a native of the
island. He had been in England, but never in Spain; nevertheless,
he seemed in touch with the situation in the ruling
country. There would, he declared, be great changes in Spain
in the next fifteen years. The King did his best in difficult
circumstances, but anti-clerical feeling was too strong to allow
of the continuation of the present state of things. In Grand
Canary there was, he said, the same feeling as in Spain against
the constant exactions of the Church. The women were still
devout, but you might go into any village and talk against the
Church and meet with sympathy from the men. He himself
was a socialist, and as such “had no country; countries were
for rich people who had something belonging to them, something
to lose; for those who had to work all countries were
the same.” He only lived in Canary, he said, because his
people were there. We pointed out that the bond with one’s
own people was precisely what made one country home and
not another, but the argument fell flat.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The great charm of the island lies in the mountainous character
of the interior region. Three roads radiate from the
capital, one along the coast to the north, another to the south,
and the third inland. Along all these it is necessary to travel
some distance before points of interest are reached, and we
were at the disadvantage of never being able to be more than
a night or two away from the ship without returning to see
how the work on board was progressing. On all the main
routes are run motor-buses, which are chiefly characterised by
indications of impending dissolution, and inspire awe by the
rapidity with which they turn corners without any preliminary
easing down. The natives, however, appeared to think that the
accidents were not unreasonably numerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to motors there are local “coaches” drawn by
horses, after the manner of covered wagonettes; they will
no doubt be gradually superseded by the motors, but still
command considerable custom. Both types of vehicles are
delightfully vague in the hours which they keep, being just
as likely to start too soon as too late, thus presupposing an
indefinite amount of time for the passengers to spend at the
starting-place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our first expedition was by the inland or middle road, which
winds up by the bleak hillside till it reaches a beautiful and
attractive country. To those unaccustomed to such latitudes,
it comes as a surprise to see fertility increasing instead of
diminishing with elevation, due to the more constant rain among
the hills. Monte and Santa Brigida may be said to be residential
neighbourhoods and have comfortable hotels and boarding-houses.
There are two principal sights to be visited from
there. One is the village of Atalaya, which consists of a zone
of cave dwellings, almost encircling the summit of a dome-shaped
hill. The eminence falls away on two sides to a deep
ravine, over which it commands magnificent views, and is
connected with the adjacent hills by a narrow coll. The rock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>is of consolidated volcanic tuff, in which the dwellings are excavated.
The fronts of the houses abut on the pathway, which
is about four feet wide, and are unequally placed, following
the contour of the ground. Each dwelling consists of two
apartments, both about twelve feet square, with rounded
angles and a domed roof, the surface of the walls shows the
chisel marks. The front apartment is used as a bed-sittingroom,
the back one as a store; and in some cases a lean-to outhouse
has been built of blocks of the same material, in which
cooking is done and the goats kept. Doors and window-sashes
are inserted into the solid stone. Both dwellings and surroundings
are beautifully clean and neat; the first one exhibited
we imagined to be a “show” apartment, till others proved
equally neat and orderly. Flowers were planted in crannies of
the rock and around the doors and windows, being carefully
tended and watered. The industry of the village is making
pots by hand without a wheel, the sand being obtained in one
direction and the clay in another: the shapes coincide in
several instances with those taken from native burial-grounds
and now to be seen in the museum at Las Palmas. The occasion
of our visit was unfortunately a <i><span lang="fr">fiesta</span></i>, and regular work
was not going on: an old lady, however, made us a model
pot in a few minutes; it was fashioned out of one piece of clay,
with the addition of a little extra material if necessary: the
pottery is unglazed. Various specimens of the art were obtained
by the Expedition and are now in the Pitt Rivers Museum at
Oxford.</p>

<p class='c007'>About half a mile from these troglodyte abodes, and adjoining
the coll, is an extraordinarily fine specimen of an extinct
crater or <em>caldero</em>. Its walls are almost vertical and unclad
by vegetation: about two-thirds of the circumference is igneous
rock, and the rest black volcanic ash, which exhibits the stratification
in the most marked manner. The crater is about 1,000
feet deep, the floor is flat and dry, and the visitor looks down
on a house at the bottom and cultivated fields.</p>

<p class='c007'>We returned to <em>Mana</em> for a night or two, and then made an
expedition by motor along the north road, sleeping at the
picturesque village of Fergas, and from thence by mule over
the beautiful mountain-track to Santa Brigida. We changed
animals <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i>, and the price asked for a fresh beast was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>outrageous. We were prepared under the circumstances to pay
it, when the portly lady of the inn, who was obviously “a
character,” beckoned us mysteriously round a corner, and,
though we had scarcely two words of any language in common,
gave us emphatically to understand that we were on no account
to be so swindled, she would see we got another. This, however,
was not accomplished for another hour, with the result
that the last part of the journey was traversed in total darkness,
and the lights of the hotel were very welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Mana</em> being still in the hands of work-people, we made our
next way by the south road to the town of Telde, near which
is a mountain known as Montana de las Cuatro Puertas, where
are a wonderful series of caves connected with the Guanches.
The road from Las Palmas skirts the sea-coast for a large part
of the way, being frequently cut into the cliff-face and in one
place passing through a tunnel: the town lies on the lowland
not far from the sea. We arrived late in the afternoon, and
endeavoured to make a bargain for rooms with the burly landlord
of the rather humble little inn. As difficulties supervened
a man who spoke a little English was called in to act as interpreter.
He turned out to be a vendor of ice-creams who had
visited London, and to make the acquaintance of the exponent
of such a trade in his native surroundings was naturally a most
thrilling experience. He expressed a great desire to return
to that land of wealth, England, though his knowledge of our
language was so extremely limited he had obviously, when
there, associated principally with his own countrymen.</p>

<p class='c007'>We went for a stroll before dark, noticing the system of
irrigation: the water is preserved in large tanks, from which
it is distributed in all directions by small channels, and so
valuable is it that these conduits are in many cases made of
stone faced with Portland cement. They are now, however,
in some instances being replaced by iron pipes, which have
naturally the merit of saving loss by evaporation. Canary is
a land where the owner of a spring has literally a gold-mine.
This is the most celebrated district for oranges. After our
evening meal we joined the company in the central <i><span lang="es">plaza</span></i> of the
little town. The moon shone down through the trees; young
men sat and smoked, and young girls, wearing white mantillas,
strolled about in companies of four or five, chatting gaily. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>elders belonged to the village club, which opened on to the
square; it was confined seemingly to one room, of which the
whole space was occupied by a billiard-table; this, however, was
immaterial, as the company spent a large part of the time in the
<i><span lang="es">plaza</span></i>, an arrangement which doubtless had the merit of saving
house rent. A little way down a side street the light streamed
from the inn windows. Nearer at hand the church stood out
against the sky; it was May, the month of the Virgin Mary, and
a special service in her honour had just concluded. One felt
a momentary expectation that Faust and Marguérite or other
friends from stage-land would appear on the scene; they may
of course have been there unrecognised by us.</p>

<p class='c007'>We discovered after much trouble that a motor-bus ran
through the village early next morning, passing close to the
mountain which we had come to visit, and could drop us on the
way. We passed a fairly comfortable night, though not undiversified
by suspicions that our beds were occupied by earlier
denizens; and had just begun breakfast when the bus appeared,
some time before the earliest hour specified. We had to tear
down and catch it, leaving the meal barely tasted; the kind
attendant following us and pressing into our hand the deserted
fried fish done up in a piece of newspaper. Such hurry, however,
proved to be quite unnecessary, as we had not got beyond
the precincts of the small town before the vehicle came to an
unpremeditated stop, through the fan which cools the radiator
having broken. We waited half an hour or so in company with
our fellow-passengers, who appeared stolidly resigned, and then,
as there seemed no obvious prospect of continuing our journey,
grew restless. Here again the ice-cream man acted as <i><span lang="la">deus ex
machina</span></i>: he was standing about with the crowd which had
assembled, blowing a horn at intervals, and distributing ices
not infrequently to small infants, whose fond mammas provided
the requisite penny; he told us he generally made a sum equal
to about one-and-sixpence a day in this manner. Grasping our
difficulty, he delivered an impassioned address on our need to
the assembled multitude, which after further delay resulted in
the appearance of a wagonette and mules. The Montana de
las Cuatro Puertas rises out of comparatively level ground near
the coast and commands magnificent views. The top is honeycombed
with caves, and one towards the north has the four
entrances from which the mountain takes its name. It is said
to have been the site of funeral rites of the inhabitants. The
place is both impressive and interesting, and would well repay
more careful study than the superficial view which was all it
was possible for us to give it.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>We decided to return to Las Palmas in the local coach, as we
had previously found travelling by this means both cheap and
quite comfortable. This time, however, our luck was otherwise.
The vehicle could have reasonably held eleven, but one passenger
after another joined it along the route, one new-comer
was constrained to find a seat on the pole, another stood on
the step, and so forth, till we numbered twenty, of all ages and
sexes. The day was hot, but the good-natured greeting, almost
welcome, which was given to each arrival by the original passengers
made us hesitate to show the feelings which consumed
us. The sentiments of the horses are not recorded, but we
gathered that they were more analogous to our own.</p>

<p class='c007'>All on <em>Mana</em> was at length ready. There were the usual
good-byes and parting duties: the bank had to be visited, all
bills settled, and letters posted. Last of all a bill of health had
to be obtained from the representative of the country to which
the ship was bound, certifying that she came from a clean port
and that all on board were well.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CAPE VERDE ISLANDS</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Cape Verde Islands are a collection of volcanic rocks, rising
out of the Atlantic, some 500 miles from the African mainland. There
are nine islands, with a total population (1911) of 142,000. The
group was first discovered by Europeans in 1446, through the agency
of one of the expeditions sent out by Prince Henry the Navigator.
Unlike the Canaries, the Cape Verde Islands when found were uninhabited;
but there were monolithic remains and other traces of
earlier visitors, all of which have unfortunately now disappeared.
The Portuguese settlers almost immediately imported negro labour,
and the present population is a mixed race. For a long time the
Leeward Islands, or southern portion of the group, attracted the
most attention, and one of them, St. Jago by name, is still the
seat of government. St. Vincent, however, which belongs to the
Windward or northern section, and was at one time a convict
settlement, is now the more important from a commercial point of
view, as its magnificent harbour, Porto Grande, forms a coaling
station for steamers bound to South America. The British consul
removed there from St. Jago during the middle of last century. It
is also the centre for the East and West Cable Company.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The next stage of our outward voyage the conditions were
again pleasant and satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>We left Las Palmas on Saturday, May 10th; the trade wind
was still with us, the weather delightful, and we did the distance
to St. Vincent, Cape Verde Islands, in seven days. We
had heard nothing but evil of it. “An impossible place;”
“another Aden;” “a mere cinder-heap.” It was therefore a
pleasant surprise to find ourselves in a most beautiful harbour.
Rugged mountains of imposing height rise on three sides of
the bay, Porto Grande, and the fourth is protected by the long
high coast-line of the neighbouring island, San Antonio. Standing
out in the entrance of the bay is the conical Birds’ Rock,
looking as if designed by nature for the lighthouse it carries.
The colouring is indescribable: all the nearer mountains are
what can only be termed a glowing red, which, as distance increases,
softens into heliotrope. On the edge of the bay and
at the foot of the eastern hills lies the town of Mindello. A
building law, made with the object of avoiding glare, forbids
any house to be painted white, and the resulting colour-washes,
red, yellow, and blue, if sometimes a little crude, tone on the
whole well into the landscape.</p>

<p class='c007'>If beauty of form and strange weird colouring are the first
things which strike the new-comer to St. Vincent, the next,
it must be admitted, is the marvellous bleakness of the place.
Hillsides and mountains stand out bare and rugged, without
showing, on a cursory inspection at any rate, the least sign
of vegetation. One of the characteristics also of the place is
the constant tearing wind. During the whole of our visit of
some ten days we were never able to find a day when it was
calm enough for Mrs. Taylor, the wife of the British Consul, to
face the short passage from the harbour and visit <em>Mana</em>. This
wind is purely local and a short distance off dies away. How,
one is inclined to ask, can it be possible for English men and
women to endure life in a tropical glare, with a perpetual wind
without any trees, any grass, any green on which to rest the
eye? And yet we found over and over again that, though the
comer from greener worlds is at first unhappy and restless in
St. Vincent, those who had been there some time found life
pleasant and enjoyable and had no desire to exchange it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several coaling and other English firms, and local
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>society rejoices in as many as thirty English ladies. The cable
company has over a hundred employees, of whom the greater
number are English. The unmarried members of the staff live
together in the station, each having a bed-sitting-room and
dining in a common hall. There is an English chaplain, and
also a Baptist minister, who is the proprietor of the principal
shop. The chaplain had the experience, which everyone must
have felt would happen some time to someone, of being carried
off involuntarily on an ocean-going steamer. He was saying
good-bye to friends, missed the warning bell, and before he
knew was <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> for a port in South America, to which he had
duly to proceed. For recreation St. Vincent possesses a tennis-court
and cricket-field: the last is in a particularly arid spot
some distance from the town, which is however already planned
out on paper by the authorities with streets and houses for
prospective needs; in the design the pitch is left vacant and
named in Portuguese “Game of Cricket,” the remainder of the
field being filled in anticipation with a grove of trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the residents have villas among the hills or by one
of the scarce oases. We made an excursion to one of these last
resorts which is a famed beauty-spot, and found it a narrow
gulch between two mountains, with a little stream and a few
unhappy vegetables and woebegone trees. It was difficult to
imagine, while traversing the road along one hillside after another,
each covered with nothing but rocks and rubble, on what
the few animals subsisted; it was remarked that the milk
could not need sterilising, as the cows fed only on stones. The
rains occur in August, after which the hills are covered with
a small green plant. We were told that some of the valleys
higher up are comparatively fruitful, and certainly it is possible
to obtain vegetables at a not unreasonable price. The
women who live in the hills carry back quite usually, after a
shopping expedition, loads of seventy to eighty pounds for a
distance of perhaps three miles, with a rise of 900 feet, making
the whole journey in two and a half hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The British Consul, Captain Taylor, R.N., has with much
enterprise established a body of Boy Scouts among the youthful
inhabitants. An attractive member of the corps, wearing a
becoming and sensible uniform, accompanied us as guide on two
occasions, when we made excursions on the island, giving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>whole afternoon to us. He declined to accept any remuneration,
as it was against the principles of his order to be paid for
doing a good turn. Other youthful natives are less useful and
more grasping. One small imp, with a swarthy complexion
and head like an overgrown radish, became our constant
follower. The acquaintance began one day when S. was carrying
a large biscuit-tin from the post office, in which some goods
had just arrived from England: he followed him down the pier,
beseeching, “Oh, Captain Biscuit-Tin, give me one penny.”
Every time after this, when S. went on shore for business or
pleasure, “Biscuit-Tin,” as we in our turn named the boy, was
there awaiting him. Once, in stepping out of the boat on to
the rusty iron ladder of the jetty, his toe almost caught on a
small round head as it emerged from the water uttering the
cry, “Oh, Captain, where is that penny?” A crowd had surrounded
the landing-stage, so the boy had dived into the water
as the easiest way of approach. He expressed the desire to come
with us to Buenos Aires, undeterred by the information which
S. gravely gave him that “all the boys on board were beaten
every day, with an extra beating on Saturday.” The avocation
which he proposed to fill was that of cook’s boy, as he “would
have much to eat.” He followed us for the whole of one expedition,
eventually obtaining “that penny” as we shoved off
from the pier for the last time, an hour before sailing. He
clapped it into his cheek, as a monkey does a nut, and held
out his hand to me for another; but I was already in the boat,
and a coin was not forthcoming; so that the last which we saw
of “Biscuit-Tin” he was still demanding “one penny.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We brought away from St. Vincent a permanent addition to
our party, a Portuguese negro of fine build, by name Bartolomeo
Rosa. The rest of the crew accepted his companionship
without hesitation and naturally christened him “Tony.”
Later we found, with sympathy, that he was wearing goloshes,
in a temperature when most of the party were only too happy
to go shoeless, because Light, who had more particularly taken
him under his wing, said “the sight of his black feet puts me
off my food.” Rosa remained with us to the end of the voyage.
He learnt English slowly, and would never have risen to the
rank of A.B., but was always quiet, steady, and dependable.
He drew but little of his wages, and had therefore a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>sum standing to his credit when we returned to Southampton.
He proposed, he said, to go back to his old mother at St. Vincent
and there set up with his earnings as a trader. He would
get a shop, stock it, and marry a wife, and she would
attend to the customers, while he would sit outside the door
on the head of a barrel and smoke. When it was suggested
that such a course would inevitably end in drink, he added a
boat to the programme, in which he would sometimes go out
and catch fish.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were detained at St. Vincent awaiting the arrival of a
spare piece of machinery, and occupied the time by watering
the yacht at the bay of Tarafel in the island of San Antonio.
A stream from the high ground there finds its way to the sea,
and supplies the water for the town of Mindello. The lower part
of its banks are fertile, forming a beautiful, if small, spot of
verdure amid the arid surroundings. Light, with the green hills
of Devonshire in mind, remarked, “It is very nice, ma’am,
what there is of it—only there is so little.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When we brought up, the men went into the shallow water
and shot the trammel in order to obtain some fresh fish. This
brought on board an elderly gentleman, Señor Martinez, the
official in charge of the place, who was not unnaturally indignant
at what he imagined to be a foreign fishing vessel at work in
territorial waters. We were able to explain matters, and were
much interested in making his acquaintance. He had never
visited England, but spoke English well, kept it up by means
of magazines, and was greatly delighted with the gift of some
literature. He welcomed us as the first English yacht which
had been there since the visit of the <em>Sunbeam</em> in 1876, of
which he spoke as if it had been yesterday.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having got our package from England, we finally quitted
the friendly harbour of Porto Grande on Thursday afternoon,
May 29th, sailing forth once more, this time to cross the Atlantic,
with the little shiver and thrill which it still gave some of us
when we committed our bodies to the deep for a long and lonely
voyage, even with every hope of a resurrection on the other
side of the ocean. After we sighted St. Jago, the capital of the
Cape Verde group, on the following day, we saw no trace of
human life for thirteen days; so that if mischance occurred
there was nothing and no one to help in all the blue sea and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>sky. The self-sufficiency needed by those who go down to the
sea in ships is almost appalling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of making direct for Pernambuco, we steered first
of all due south, carrying with us the north-east trade, in order
to cross the Doldrums to the best advantage, and catch the
south-east trade as soon as possible on the other side. The
calm belt may be expected just north of the Equator, but its
position varies with climatic conditions, and it was therefore
a matter of excitement to know how long we should keep the
wind. In the opinion of our authorities it might leave us on
Sunday and could not be with us beyond Tuesday. The
engineer, whose duty had so far been light, had been chaffingly
warned by the rest of the crew that his turn would come in
the tropics, when he would have to work below for twenty-four
hours on end.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Sunday S. gave orders that the engine was to be started
by day or night, whenever the officer in command of the
watch thought it necessary; but still the north-east trade held
good. On Monday all hands were at work stowing the mainsail,
for as soon as the calm came the squalls were expected
which are typical of that part of the world. On Tuesday evening,
when according to calculation we should have been out of
its zone, we were still travelling before the wind, and we began
to congratulate ourselves with trembling, that our passage
would be more rapid than we had ventured to hope. All
Wednesday, however, the breeze was very light, and we kept
our finger on its pulse as on that of a sick man. By Thursday
it had faded and had died away, the sails hung slack, the gear
rattled noisily, the motor was run. The air was hot, damp,
and sticky, with heavy squalls, and the nights were trying. It
is impossible to sleep on the deck of a small sailing ship, with
so many strings about and someone always pulling at something,
so we roamed from our berths to cabin floors and saloon
settees and back again, “seeking rest and finding none.” The
thermometer in the cabin never throughout the voyage rose to
more than eighty-three degrees, but, as is well known, it is
humidity and lack of air rather than the absolute height of temperature
which determine comfort. Friday afternoon increased
air roused our hopes; but, alas! it soon subsided, and during the
night we again relied on the engine. Saturday morning was
still squally, with a grey sea and heavy showers, but there was
really a slight breeze. Was it or was it not, we asked under
our breath, the beginning of the new wind? By ten o’clock
there was no longer room for doubt: the south-east trade was
blowing strong and full, and the ship, like some living creature
suddenly let loose, bounding away before it for very joy. It
felt like nothing so much as a wonderful gallop over ridge and
furrow after a long and anxious wait at covert-side.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>We crossed the Equator in glorious weather about 9 p.m. on
Monday, June 9th. None of the forecastle had been over
before: Father Neptune did not feel equal to visiting them,
but some addition to the fare was much appreciated. I was
the doyen of the party, with now seven crossings to my
credit. Flying-fish came at times on board from the shoals
through which we passed, “Portuguese men-of-war” floated by
the ship, and schools of porpoises played about her bows. The
wind on the whole stood our friend for the rest of the way,
and during the last week of the voyage the average daily run
was 147 miles on our course, the highest record being 179
miles on June 14th. We continued, however, to have squalls
and rain at intervals, as we were running into the rainy season;
and it was through a mist that on Sunday, June 15th, after a
passage of seventeen days, we strained our eyes to see the
South American coast. It dawned at last on our view, a
flat and somewhat low land; then came into sight the towers
and coconut palms of Pernambuco, and the passage of the
Atlantic was accomplished.</p>

<p class='c019'>After the discovery of the New World its possession was contested
by five sea-going nations of Western Europe—the Spanish, Portuguese,
French, English, and Dutch. Of these the Spanish and
Portuguese were first in the field, and the Portuguese established
themselves in that part of the southern continent now known as
Brazil. Their acquisition of this particular territory was largely due
to accident: the Portuguese navigator Cabral, sailing in 1500 for
the East Indies, via the Cape of Good Hope, shaped his course so far
to the west, in order to avoid the calms off the African continent,
that he hit off this part of the coast. An important Portuguese
settlement grew up on the bay known as Bahia de Todos os Santos
(All Saints’ Bay). Further south French Huguenots were the first
to discover and colonise the bay of Rio de Janeiro, but the Portuguese
finally succeeded in expelling them in 1567, when Rio became the
capital of the southern portion of their territory, Bahia retaining its
pre-eminence in the north.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the seventeenth century Portugal, and consequently her overseas
possessions, fell for a while under the dominion of Spain; with
the result that the settlers acquired a new foe in the young power of
the Dutch, with whom the Spaniards were at war. The Dutch
West India Company was formed with the especial object of capturing
Brazil: the first fleet, which sailed in 1623, gained for a time
possession of Bahia, and in 1629 the Dutch conquered Olinda and
the neighbouring town of Recife, or Pernambuco, where they established
themselves under the able leadership of Prince Mauritz of
Nassau. In 1640, however, the Portuguese threw off the Spanish
yoke, and, as the quarrel of Holland had been with the latter, she
allowed herself to be bought out of her conquests in Brazil; an
arrangement due in part to the intervention of Charles II of England,
who had married a Portuguese princess. There was an old alliance
between this country and Portugal, and when in 1739 war broke out
between England and Spain, occasioned by the wrongs of a certain
Captain Jenkins whose ear the Spaniards had cut off, Commodore
Anson selected a Brazilian harbour in which to revictual his ships
on his way to harry the Spanish in the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the Napoleonic wars the history of Europe again affected
Brazil. In 1808, when the French were on the point of entering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Lisbon, the royal family escaped overseas, established their court
at Rio de Janeiro, and made Brazil a kingdom. In 1820 King João
VI returned to Portugal, leaving his son Pedro in command, and the
mother country sought to reduce Brazil once more to the provincial
status. This was resisted by the colonists, who had tasted the sweets
of authority; they declared themselves independent, and made
Pedro, who was personally popular, into Emperor of Brazil. Pedro
was succeeded by his son, who reigned till 1889; in that year a
revolution occurred, due partly to defects of government, partly to
the discontent caused by the emancipation of the slaves. Pedro II
left for Europe, and Brazil was declared a republic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pernambuco, or Recife, has been built on low land at the junction
of two rivers, and has the advantage of a good harbour, protected
by a natural reef, which has been improved by artificial
means. The town has grandiosely, but not altogether inaptly,
been called a “modern Venice”; the business quarter, or
Recife proper, is built on a peninsula formed by one of the
rivers, while the windings of the other divide the remaining
part of the town into sections, which have to be crossed and recrossed
by bridges. Otherwise the place is not attractive, the
site has originally been a quagmire, and the roads have been
made by merely levelling the ground and covering it with
rounded stones; they now consist principally of shallow lakes
and crevasses. The streets, with the exception of a few new
thoroughfares, are little more than lanes and just wide enough
for two vehicles to pass. Most of the traffic is done by mule
trams, and any other vehicles, except when they can get on
the tram lines, are obliged to move at a snail’s pace. It is
difficult to understand how the motors contrive to exist, but
they are fairly numerous. The houses are of stucco and outrival
those of St. Vincent in brilliancy of colouring. The
authorities at the time of our visit had been seized with the
laudable desire to reconstruct the town on a large and ambitious
plan, the object being to rival the larger towns further south,
and, in view of their growing prosperity, to keep a place also in
the sun for Pernambuco. This form of civic patriotism plays
a noticeable and unexpected part in various South American
towns. The result at the moment was to make the place appear,
in certain districts, as if it had suffered by fire or bombardment.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible not to be struck when walking the streets
with the great varieties of type, and consequently of colouring,
among the populace. The original races have been the native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Indian, the European who conquered the land, and the Negro
imported for his services, and there are now, in addition to their
pure-blooded descendants, every shade and mixture of the three.
The colour of a man’s skin is however of little or no social concern,
and there is an absence of race prejudice which to the Anglo-Saxon
mind is very astonishing. We had the pleasure of visiting
the opera on a gala night at the kind invitation of the British
Consul and his sister, Mr. and Miss Dickie, and saw much
mixture of colouring among the upper classes. The subject of
the opera was romantic and dealt with the early Portuguese
era, the heroine being carried off by Indian raiders. Women
of all shades have a very proper idea of the consideration due
to them, though there would seem to be no reason even to
the most advanced of us why, as was said to be the case, a
negress should consider it beneath her dignity to carry a
message across the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>The political situation is apparently liable to surprises. At
the principal music-hall, just before our visit, an accident
occurred to the driving-chain of the electric light, causing a
certain amount of clatter; the audience immediately sprang to
their feet, the women shrieked, and there was a general stampede.
It had been immediately concluded that the noise was
caused by pistol shots and heralded a revolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The economic standing of Pernambuco and the why and
wherefore of its existence are a puzzle to the stranger. There is
no appearance of any considerable quantity of trade or wealth,
indeed, to judge by the notices displayed, the inhabitants live
principally on mutual doctoring and pulling out each other’s
teeth. The cost of living is nevertheless very high, owing
largely to the fact that everything seems to be brought from
overseas. Stone for building is conveyed all the way from
Northern Europe, and a Norwegian barque, which lay beside
us, was busy unloading timber at the door of the forests of
Brazil. Even the common articles in use are brought from the
Old World, and the tables of the restaurants are crowded with
imported products, in spite of almost prohibitive tariffs, which
raise the price of a ham, for example, to four or five times its
original value. In addition special prices are at times reserved
for strangers: the yacht’s steward was allowed to depart without
purchasing a packet of cigarettes for which eightpence was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>asked; Rosa, with his dark skin, got the identical article for
a penny.</p>

<p class='c007'>We followed one of the rivers in the launch almost as far as
it is navigable, a distance of some nine miles. The banks are
low, and were at first covered with mangrove; later the land
was cultivated after a fashion, and there were a certain number
of country houses, but in a state of dilapidation and decay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anyone who wishes to leave the prosaic present and be transported
back to the old times of colonisation should visit Olinda,
the ancient seat of government, which lies three miles to the
north of Pernambuco. The remains of it to-day are a little
group of houses standing picturesquely on a wooded promontory,
which rises high above the low-lying coast. The old
street, winding up to the top of the semi-deserted city, along
which must have passed gay cavalcades, sober monks, and captured
Indians, is still the high way, but it is now carpeted with
grass, kept short, not by traffic, but by the sheep which browse
upon it. From the highest point, the view extends in one direction
to the sea and in the other to the forests of the interior.
The most arresting feature is the number of churches and religious
houses: everywhere the eye turns these great buildings
rise among the luxuriant foliage, from one standpoint we
counted ten such edifices. Some are deserted; some are still
inhabited. The Franciscan establishment, where a fraternity
still occupy the conventual buildings, is said to have been the
first of its kind in Brazil, but we could arrive at nothing more
definite as to date from the brother who acted as guide than
that the place was “three hundred years old.” The church contained
some particularly good Dutch tiles representing scenes
from the life of the Virgin and St. Ann; similar ones are to be
seen in the cathedral, which was undergoing repair, and where
no means were being taken to preserve them from injury at the
hands of the workmen. These edifices were presumably rebuilt
after the capture of the place by the Dutch; for Olinda is said
to have been so utterly destroyed by the fighting, of which it
was the centre, that Prince Maurice of Nassau gave his attention
instead to the improvement of Recife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our regrets at leaving Pernambuco on Saturday, June 21st,
after a stay of six days, were mitigated by the heat of the docks
and by the fact that for some nights the mosquitoes had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>unceasingly active. As soon as we left S. started an exterminating
campaign, and killed sixty straight away in his own
cabin and the saloon. For weeks afterwards, Mr. Gillam could
be seen daily going on his rounds with a bottle of quinine tabloids,
the lambs obediently swallowing the same. His medicinal doses
were under all circumstances magnificently heroic, some of his
remedies being kept in quart bottles, on the principle, as he
explained, that it was “no use spoiling the ship for a halfpennyworth
of tar.” It was doubtful in this case if the enemy were
really of the malaria-carrying type; they did not appear to
stand on their heads in the correct manner—anyway, we all
escaped contagion with one slight exception, though I myself
had had a bad attack shortly before leaving England, brought
on by influenza, after six years’ complete immunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had now before us a voyage of some 3,000 miles down
the eastern coast of South America before the Magellan Straits
were reached. It was marvellously impressive sailing day after
day along the coast-line of a great continent, although at the
moment the said coast was sandy and flat, the only diversity
being occasional lights at night from some town on the shore.
Bahia de Todos os Santos, more generally known simply as
Bahia, was our next destination. Some fine Portuguese houses
are said to survive from the days when it was the old capital,
and it may be remembered as the locality where Robinson
Crusoe was engaged in planting tobacco, when he was induced
to go on the slave-raiding voyage which led to his best-known
adventure. The bay, which runs north and south, extends
for twenty-five miles, and the situation of the town on its east
side is distinctly fine; part of it has been built on the shore, and
part on the top of rising ground immediately above it. The
funicular railway which connects the one with the other is to be
seen from the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>This unfortunately is all that circumstances allow us to
record. The anchor was dropped at midday, Wednesday,
June 25th, and orders given for luncheon to be served at once,
so that we might go on shore as soon as we had got our pratique.
The health officer, when he came on board, was found to speak
nothing but Portuguese, which made communication difficult;
the same had been the case with the pilot at Pernambuco; and
as half the vessels visiting those ports are English it might perhaps be suggested, without insular pride, that a smattering of
that language, or at least of French, might be desirable in such
officials. We produced the bill of health from Pernambuco in
ordinary course: this, however, did not satisfy the doctor. He
asked for that from St. Vincent, then from Las Palmas, and
finally from Falmouth, though we pointed out that, as this had
been granted three months ago, it scarcely had a practical bearing
on the case: the virgin health of Bahia must, we felt, indeed be
immaculate to require such protection. Finally the bill was
stamped and passed. Then the officer handed in a marvellous
paper of directions given in English, which stated that “if the
captain went on shore all boats’ crews were to return immediately
to the ship; that no one was to be on shore after 7 p.m.; no
fruit was to be bought from hucksters, and none was to be
eaten till it had been in a cool place for three days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We felt that it had become our turn to inquire after the
health of Bahia, and it was reluctantly admitted that yellow
fever was raging. Upon hearing this we metaphorically gathered
our skirts around us, and, although greatly disappointed to miss
seeing the town, naturally decided that we would not land.
A quaint position then arose, as the doctor, with an eye probably
to the fee involved, stated that the ship could not leave unless S.
went on shore and obtained a new bill of health, a proceeding
at which, as may be supposed, he drew the line. As the official
had no means of enforcing authority, victory remained with
<em>Mana</em>, but, even so we were left wondering whether the stain on
our moral character of the Bahia endorsement of our certificate
would secure us quarantine at our next port. We spent the
night in the bay some distance from shore, in order that Mr.
Ritchie might test the compass by swinging the vessel.</p>

<p class='c007'>After we left Bahia the coast-line was at times broken by
islands, and varied inland by hills which rose behind wooded
banks and sandy shores. We had plenty of time to make notes
of any features of interest, for the landmarks on the shore became
quite old friends before we parted company. The weather
became cooler, the cabin thermometer ranging from 75° to 80°;
but we met with an unexpected and persistent head wind; long
tacks seemed to bring us but little forward, and <em>Mana</em> presented
the pathetic spectacle of a good ship struggling against adversity.
The log day after day gave the depressing chronicle of only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>some twenty to thirty miles of progress, and the 700 miles to
Rio de Janeiro began to appear interminable. After some five
days of this weary work, making eleven since we had left Pernambuco,
S. decided that it would be in the interests of all to obtain
a change by making the shore along which we were sailing. He
therefore, after careful study of the Sailing Directions, selected
a spot where health officers would not be found—Cabral Bay.
Our Navigator thought the entrance somewhat risky, and requested
written orders before going in: as, however, rashness
is not one of my husband’s sins I awaited the result with
equanimity. It is the small bay where Cabral landed on
April 24th, 1500, two days after discovering the continent. He
erected a cross on the site of the present village, took possession
of the land for the King of Portugal, and christened it Santa
Cruz, a name which was changed in the middle of the sixteenth
century to Brazil, from <em>brasa</em>, the term applied by the Portuguese
to the brilliant red wood of its forests. The village and
northern part of the bay continue, however, to bear the name
of Santa Cruz, while the southern portion is called after the
great navigator.</p>

<p class='c007'>The land which forms the bay consists of a low ridge, two miles
or so in length, covered with brushwood and undergrowth; it
is arrested suddenly to the north by the course of a river, which
has here made a passage to the ocean, and ends abruptly in a
steep white cliff. Between the cliff and the river nestles the
small village of Santa Cruz, and on the height stands a church
which forms the landmark for ships entering the bay. Up the
hillside winds a little white path where the grass has been worn
away by the feet of worshippers ascending to the house of prayer.
At its southern end the ridge dies gradually away in a little
promontory, on which stands a tall cross of wood with an inscription
stating that it was erected by the Capuchins on the
date 22.3.98, but whether that was yesterday, or one hundred, or
two or three hundred years ago, there is nothing to show. In
front of the bay is a coral reef, so that only baby waves break
over the sandy beach, and hard by the cross is a stream, with
low reaches and dark shady pools overhung by mangroves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we spent two days, watered the ship from the stream,
bathed, fished, and revelled in the wind and sunshine, feeling
like prehistoric men, and at one with all creation, from amœbas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to angels. The men from the village, dark and lithe, came to
visit us in dug out canoes, hollowed in true Robinson Crusoe
fashion from the trunks of trees, and lent us a hand in our work,
after which we had out the launch and gave them a tow back
to the village. There we found the kindest welcome and walked
up the little white path to the church. It was tattered and
dirty; but old women with interesting faces, who came in to see
the strangers, knelt devoutly at the altar-rails before putting
out a hand to greet us. When we departed the inhabitants came
to the river-side, where also stands a cross, though whether it is
that erected by Cabral or not this history cannot say; they gave
us presents, fired rockets, and waved us adieu to the last. Life
might be hard at Santa Cruz, but at least it seemed quiet and
peaceful. As <em>Mana</em> went out of the bay there was a stormy
sunset over the church and a wonderful rainbow in the east;
gradually the cross on the promontory faded away, the breaking
waves on the coral reef could no longer be heard, and so, as John
Bunyan would say, “we went on our way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On leaving Cabral Bay we stood out to sea as the best chance
of obtaining a fair wind, and the weather gradually became
more favourable. One particularly clear evening, July 8th,
at sunset, we were able to see a peak on the mainland which is
just under 7,000 feet in height at a distance of ninety-six miles.
Altogether it was a pleasant run, occupied by the Stewardess in
reading geology and darning stockings. We had not been able
completely to fill our water-tanks at Santa Cruz, and it was now
decided to procure the remainder at Cape Frio, which was seventy
miles this side of Rio de Janeiro, rather than risk the quality
which might be obtainable in the city. As we returned to the
coast we found that its low character had given way to a region
of hills, cliffs, and islands. Cape Frio itself is a bold rocky promontory,
or rather island, for it is separated from the mainland
by a narrow passage, and shelters behind it a romantic basin
consisting of a series of small coves. In places the surrounding
mountains recede sufficiently to allow of little sandy beaches,
elsewhere sheer cliffs covered with verdure come down to the
margin, and trees and ferns overhang the water. We entered
by moonlight, and the dark shadows and sparkling sand made a
striking and effective contrast.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one cove is a fishing village, with a church and small store.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Here for the first time oranges were valued as a native product,
so far they had been no cheaper than in England, and at threepence
a dozen the forecastle and midships bought them by the
bathful. The facilities for obtaining water next day proved not
so good as had been hoped. I left S. superintending the crew,
as they staggered through the surf to the cutter with bags of
water from the village well, and ascended 300 or 400 feet to a
signal station on the landward side of the gorge which cuts off
the outlying island. This commanded a magnificent view of a
wide stretch of blue Atlantic and the adjacent coast; in the
direction of Rio was a panorama of low lands and lagoons,
bordered by ranges of rugged mountains which rose tier upon tier
as far as the eye could reach. On the way down I gathered a
spray of bougainvillea from a shrub in full bloom.</p>

<p class='c007'>S. had meanwhile made acquaintance with the storekeeper
and general village factotum, who we had already found, to our
surprise, spoke English well. He turned out, as might have been
expected, to be a German. The history of his life would probably
be interesting. His experiences included at any rate residence
at Bonn University and the post of steward on the yacht of the
late Mr. Pierpont Morgan, but who or what had brought him
to this spot did not transpire. He had at one time become
naturalised as a citizen of Brazil, but had subsequently laid down
his rights, preferring to keep out of public concerns, for, as he
naïvely remarked, “they never talk politics here without killing
a man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lore of Frio was as romantic as its appearance, and
worthy of the pen of Stevenson. Not only have traces come to
light on a neighbouring promontory of Indian burials consisting
of bones and pottery, but more valuable treasure finds were of
not infrequent occurrence; buried Spanish coins turned up at
intervals, and an ingot of silver had lately been discovered.
There was no doubt, in the opinion of the storekeeper, that considerable
treasure was hidden among the islands along the coast,
but hunting for it was forbidden by the government. Not far
from the village itself there was a cave, which was obviously the
work of man, and said to connect two coves, but no one dared
to explore it. Nothing was known of its history, but, according
to tradition, it was the work of the Jesuits: why a religious
order should have made such a resort our informant was unable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to explain, but he evidently considered that it would be quite
in accord with their usual underground and mysterious methods
of procedure. Thirty years ago he himself, with the owner of
the cave and one other, had taken up a barrel of wine and had
a drinking bout at its entrance, a scene which some old painter
of the Dutch school would surely have found congenial: he had
then penetrated some twenty or thirty yards into the interior;
it was at first, he said, narrow, then became wider, but since that
time no one had entered it.</p>

<p class='c007'>S. was naturally fired with a desire to explore this hidden
cavern; Mr. Gillam responded to the call for an assistant,
and they set out for the place, accompanied by our informant.
There proved to be some difficulty in discovering it, even with
his assistance, owing to the dense vegetation which had arisen
since it was last visited. Mr. Gillam’s thoughts not unnaturally
turned to snakes, and the information given in reply to a question
on the subject lacked something in reassurance: there were
a great many about, it was said, and of a dangerous kind, but
they only struck when trodden upon, and as it was now getting
late in the day it might be hoped that they had retired to their
lairs. When the cave was at length found, bushes and undergrowth
had to be cut down in order to effect an entrance, and a
cloud of bats flew out of the darkness within. The walls were
examined by the light of a ship’s signalling lantern, and the
statement that they had been artificially made was proved to be
true. The party proceeded for ten or twelve yards, but then
found that the way had been blocked by a comparatively
recent fall of débris, and the enterprise had therefore to be
abandoned. We commend it to fellow-voyagers and anthropologists.</p>

<p class='c007'>We sailed the next morning at daybreak and our navigator,
instead of taking the eastern road, by which we had come
in, and going round the island, decided to attempt as a short
cut the much narrower exit on the west, which lay between
the precipitous cliffs that separated the cape proper from the
mainland. By the soundings recorded on the chart there was
everywhere sufficiency of water for our draught, but, while
approaching the coast to take a direct course through the gorge,
we were suddenly aware that the stern of the vessel had taken
the ground. There was a moment of anxiety as to whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>she had hit on an outlying rock, but happily she had only come
in contact with a bank of drifted sand. We were, however, very
near a rocky coast, and it was not far from high water. As
much weight as possible was taken into the bows, a kedge was
carried out astern, and she was hove off the way she came on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning we were at the entrance to Rio de Janeiro.
There was, however, not a breath of wind, and the engine was
giving trouble; it refused to run more than a very short distance
without becoming dangerously heated—a state of things subsequently
found to be due entirely to improper installation. We
sat, therefore, for twelve hours gazing at the tumbled mass of
blue mountain-barrier, through the narrow opening in which
the sea has found its way and formed the great sheet of water
within. In front of us was the well-known conical form of the
Sugar-loaf, to the west Corcovado, the Hunchback, with its
strange effect of a peak which is bending forward, and beyond
it Gavea with its table-top. The night fell, lights came out
within, we still waited like a Peri at the gate of Paradise.
The evening breeze, however, wafted us nearer, and at midnight
we passed silently between the dark heights which guarded the
entrance and dropped anchor in Botafogo Bay under the shelter
of the Sugar-loaf, there to await the dawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is an entrancing experience to wake on a sunny morning
and find oneself for the first time among the soft and glowing
beauty of Rio Harbour. We went up the bay in the early light,
with a man posted at the flagstaff to exchange greetings with
the Brazilian men-of-war which lay at anchor; it was always our
duty to dip first to warships, as it was the place of merchantmen
to take the initiative with us. We finally took up our position
some three miles higher up opposite to the old city.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the suicidal fate of each visitor to try to describe Rio
de Janeiro, and fail in the attempt; but with every warning to
refrain the present chronicler must likewise rush on her doom.
The first impression is that there is so much of it. It is not
merely an enormous and beautiful bay, with a city upon it—it
is a huge expanse of water, of which the whole margin, as far as
the eye can reach, is used by man for his dwelling. To compare
it with the bays of Naples or Palermo, or with the cities of
Edinburgh or Athens, is, as far as size is concerned, to speak in
the same breath of some picturesque manor-house and of Windsor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Castle. There are many places with wilder charm or more
historic interest; but for what can only be termed “sleek beauty”
Rio is incomparable. Every portion of the scenery is right,
there are no parts of it which the eye consciously or unconsciously
omits, and in whichever direction the gazer looks his æsthetic
sense is satisfied. The shore line disdains monotony and breaks
itself into bays and islands. The great mountains, though they
may lose in quiet dignity, range themselves in weird and striking
shapes which attract the eye, while the verdure fulfils its purpose
of showing off their beauty, here clothing a hillside with forest,
there leaving bare a towering cliff. The white buildings which
wander up hill and down dale are clean and prosperous, neither
too new nor too old; they surround bays and stretch out to
islands, not in oppressive continuity, but broken with the surface
of the ground, while the gardens and boulevards with their
tropical foliage know just how to intersperse themselves at the
right intervals. The sun and air also appreciate their share in
the situation, and flood mountain and water, verdure and the
work of man, with wonderful transparent light, till the whole
shines pure and soft, blue and green, like an opal. The night
is not less beautiful; then the summits of the mountains show
dark against the sky, myriads of lights outline the near bays,
shine out from the islands and twinkle irregularly up the hillsides,
while from the further shore another galaxy are reflected half-way
across the still dark water. The whole gives the impression of
some magic scene in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> lit up for a great <i><span lang="fr">fiesta</span></i>.
Rio is wonderful, marvellous; it leaves one like the Queen of
Sheba; and yet—when I am dead I hope that I may return and
visit the little bay of Santa Cruz, I know I shall pass by Rio
de Janeiro.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old part of the city is composed of narrow and noisy
lanes, but the new boulevards are fine and broad. We did the
usual sightseeing, with the details of which it is not proposed
to trouble the reader. We had the pleasure of enjoying the
hospitality of our Minister, Sir W. Haggard; but to my disappointment,
for I had been looking forward for weeks to some
feminine society, Lady Haggard was in England, and everyone
else seemed to be a bachelor. By the most kind care of the
British Consul, Mr. Hamblock, we had a memorable motor drive
of some seventy miles through the mountains to the west of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>bay, including the tract of forest reserved for the public by Dom
Pedro. It has left us with a bewildered impression of roads
winding below great crags, amongst tropical vegetation, and
opening at intervals on vistas of rocky coast and deep blue sea.
We visited the botanical gardens, admiring their marvellous
avenue of palms: similar ones, and but little inferior, may be
seen in many directions, rising amongst streets and houses like
the pillars of a Greek temple. We ascended the Sugar-loaf
by aerial railway, and gained a panoramic view of the harbour.
Finally, a day was spent at Petropolis, a small place among the
mountains at the head of the bay, which is reached by a railway
with cog-wheel gauge and is the special resort of the diplomatic
colony. We lunched at an inn of which the walls were adorned
impartially with portraits of the Hohenzollerns and French
Presidents, the host turned out to be an Alsatian.</p>

<p class='c007'>If at Rio every prospect pleases it is not altogether free from
drawbacks: sanitary conditions have improved; but the pride
the city takes in its public gardens and boulevards does not
extend to the water of the harbour, which is repulsively dirty,
and ships are warned in the Sailing Directions against using it
even for washing their decks. When the American fleet visited
Rio they consumed so much from the shore for that purpose,
that there is said to have been almost a fresh-water famine in
the city. When we left the bay our bill of health stated that the
previous week there had been two cases of yellow fever, both
dead, and two of bubonic plague, who were still alive. Even
with our experience at Pernambuco the prices charged at Rio left
us breathless: engineering work cost from four to five times as
much as in England; even a poor man on the docks complained
to our Sailing-master that he could not get a meal under 2s. 8d.
One Englishman, professionally employed, calculated that the
cost of his passage home every three years was met through
the saving effected on buying his clothes in England. Finally,
the Stewardess of the <em>Mana</em> was of the opinion that the limit was
reached, when one shilling was charged for washing a pair of
stockings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Brazilians of Rio appear to have more European blood
than those who live further north, though a mixture of Indian or
Negro is viewed with the same equanimity. The idea of government
is democratic, and in theory at any rate the President will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>give an audience to the humblest Brazilian. The senators are
paid £7 a day while sitting, so that an easy way of defraying
debt is to prolong the session. The Central Railway belongs to the
Government, and is regarded as giving billets for its supporters:
engine-drivers, for example, are paid at a rate of from £700 per
annum, the consequent large deficit on the working of the line
being made good by the Treasury. There had been no political
excitement very recently at Rio, but one old man was pointed
out to us who, as governor of a northern state, had held his
position by force and fraud until about a year previously, when
he had been escorted by armed men on board ship and told
that if he returned he would be shot.</p>

<p class='c007'>We left Rio Harbour at daybreak on Wednesday, July 23rd,
after a visit of nine days, and to our relief found a good sailing
breeze outside. As Buenos Aires, at which we were bound
to call for stores and letters, was still some 1,100 miles
distant, it was decided to break the voyage, and the Sailing
Directions were studied for some out-of-the-way stopping-place
<i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i>. We had found by experience that little anchorages
were preferable: not only was there more confidence in the water
supply than in the case of big towns, but there was no trouble
with authorities, and bills of health, and the temptations of a big
port were avoided. The smaller places also, if in some ways less
interesting, were more attractive. The little bay of Porto Bello
was selected, but when its neighbourhood was reached the
following Sunday the weather had become rather thick and there
was some difficulty in finding our way. At tea-time our Navigator
came down somewhat amused to tell us that, during our afternoon
siestas, <em>Mana</em> had wandered in and out of a wrong bay, about
twenty miles north of our destination; a small steamer in front
of us had also obviously been in need of a signpost or kind
policeman.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Sunday afternoon we dropped anchor safely in a sheltered
part of Porto Bello Bay known as Aco Cove. Our previous
halts, the town of Pernambuco, the coral bay at Santa Cruz,
the rocky basin of Cape Frio, and the world-famed harbour of
Rio de Janeiro, bore little resemblance to each other, but they
had one point in common, that they were all obviously South
American. Porto Bello had nothing South American about it
save its very unoriginal Spanish name; it might, as far as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>general appearance went, have been a loch imported straight
from the west coast of Scotland: the accent of our Glasgow
engineer became unconsciously more homelike, as he remarked
that it was “just like the scenery near Oban,” and to add to the
illusion the weather, though warm, was a “wee bit saft,” with
the nip in the air associated with Scotland in August.</p>

<p class='c007'>The town of Porto Bello itself lies at the foot of the bay. It
will be found marked in the atlas of the infallible Stieler, but it is
nothing more than a hamlet, consisting of a few small houses,
with a church and one little store; there was no inn visible, but
it is apparently connected with the outside world by telegraph
or telephone. Shanties, surrounded with banana groves, wandered
up the hillsides or clustered round such sandy coves as
Aco; some were made of wattle and daub, others of wooden
planks roofed with banana leaves or rough red tiles. We made
friends with a family who occupied a cottage near the stream
which supplied our water, and some of the party, a grandfather,
father, and small daughter, came off on their own initiative to
pay us a visit on board. They brought presents of eggs and
molasses, and three special shells as an offering for me. The
gifts which we on our side found were most appreciated, both
here and elsewhere, were tobacco, sweets, and ships’ biscuits;
the last were specially prized, being often preferred to money.
We showed our visitors over the vessel, and expected that such
fittings as electric light would produce a mild sensation, but it
was proved as usual that the eye can only take in what it has
sufficient knowledge to appreciate. The greatest success was
achieved by the supply of carpenters’ tools, which excited much
admiration, while the pier-glass in my cabin came in a poor
second. A rather embarrassing situation arose when the old
man, who was getting a little imbecile, found the yacht so
attractive that he sat down in the deck-house and declined to
depart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quiet lives of these people, surrounded by agricultural
holdings with tropical produce, reminded us much of the existence
of some of the natives in East Africa. They were
apparently not above the belief in charms, for opposite our friends’
door was a dried bush about four feet high, which had on the
extremity of each bough an eggshell, some fifteen in number;
we never succeeded in finding out its precise meaning, for unfortunately our ignorance of the Portuguese language made any
real conversation impossible. The appliances of life were simple:
an ox-cart had solid wooden wheels, after the manner of an ancient
British chariot, the noise made by which was portentous; and
the anchors of the boats were of wood, the shank being formed
of a frame of sticks, into which rocks were packed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>The business of watering the ship being ended, we tried to
continue our journey, only to find that a dead calm reigned
outside, and there was nothing to do but to return. Two or three
days of detention passed very pleasantly exploring hill-tracks,
photographing, and sketching. We were able to buy poultry,
eggs, and oranges, and the men were very successful with the
seine, getting quantities of delightful mullet. One afternoon we
took our tea in the launch to the other side of the bay, but here
for the only time we found the people a little suspicious and not
quite friendly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Saturday, August 2nd, we again made our way out of Porto
Bello. Our course lay in the direction of the island of Sta.
Catharina, some twenty miles to the southwards, and the whole
of the next day we drifted along in sight of its beautiful mountainous
coast-line. This was the rendezvous appointed by
Anson for his fleet on his outward voyage, as it possessed an
excellent reputation for stores. He sailed there direct from
Madeira, arriving in December 1740; his voyage took forty-five
days, as against our forty-eight days at sea to Porto Bello, by
Cape Verde Islands and Pernambuco. Anson was, however,
disappointed in his reception, as the governor proved himself
unfriendly, and sent a messenger to communicate the presence
of the squadron to the Spanish admiral, who lay with his ships
in the River Plate. We occupied the time in endeavouring
to check from the yacht the sketches given of the coast in
the contemporary account of his voyage. Later on we more
than once found ourselves on Anson’s track.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following days afforded great variety of weather, but it
grew rapidly colder, and warm clothes which had been stowed
since Madeira had to be brought out. The wind, which for a
time was strong and fair, later veered round to the south-east
and subsequently to the south-west. Our navigators were early
anxious about the indications, fearing a <i><span lang="es">pampero</span></i>, the name by
which the particular gales are known which sweep down from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the Andes over the <i><span lang="es">pampas</span></i> or great plains of the mainland, and
on Monday, August 4th, the mainsail was stowed. Thursday
we had a strong wind, accompanied by a most extraordinary
display of lightning; from midnight till 5 a.m. the place was
lighted up almost without intermission, and there were reported
to be at times as many as five to eight flashes visible at once; at
first there was no thunder, but subsequently it became audible.
The next two days we beat against a head wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday evening we were placidly seated at dinner when
the cry came, “All hands on deck.” Suddenly, without at the
last a moment’s warning, the <i><span lang="es">pampero</span></i> was upon us. A half-finished
meal was left to hurry up the companion and join in
stowing sails. All night long the gale raged, straining at the
rigging, tossing the ship from side to side, rattling everything in
her above and below. The waves swept over the deck until it
seemed as if their force might at any moment carry away the
boats or burst in the door of the deck-house; notwithstanding
the heavy storm-boards with which it was always barricaded at
such times. There was no sleep for anyone on board. The
steward was up all night making cocoa for those on deck, for it
was bitterly cold. As to the watch below, “a man,” as Mr.
Gillam said, “who could care so little what was going on above
as to be able to sleep on such a night, simply because he was off
duty, was no sailor worth the name.” Four a.m. found two
of us engaged in meditating on the “wet sea boy” who
managed to have his eyelids sealed on the giddy mast during
“the visitation of the wind,” wondering whether he was an
Elizabethan product or if we only owe his creation to the fact
that Shakespeare was a landsman. I believe, from continued
observation, that a good crew really like a gale, it has the “joy
of battle.” As to the Stewardess, her journal, which is not given
to soliloquising, runs, I find, as follows in connection with the
<i><span lang="es">pampero</span></i>: “It has been made painfully clear to me that my
presence on deck when things are bad is an added anxiety; this
is humiliating, and will not, I trust, apply to the next generation
of females.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When I came up next morning the wind was still raging
fiercely, but there was a pale blue sky flecked with white clouds,
and bright sunshine sparkled on the countless white crests of
foam which covered a dark blue sea. I looked, with an instinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>which during all these months had become second nature, to see
who was at the wheel, and found, with a shock, that it was
deserted—the helm was lashed! It felt for a moment as if the
ship were some dead thing, with all power of spontaneous movement,
all volition gone. For the time being she was vanquished
by the elements, or at least reduced to armed truce; we were
hove to and drifting slowly eastward, undoing all the work of
the last two days. “Rough on us, ma’am,” as Light said with
a jovial laugh. At noon we had lost ground by 24 miles, and
were now 373 miles from Buenos Aires instead of 349.</p>

<p class='c007'>Monday, 7 a.m., we began to sail, beating against the wind,
but by midday we had lost still further, being now 402 miles away
from the haven where we would be. We envied the cape pigeons,
twenty or thirty of which followed the vessel, as she was towing
bags of heavy oil to windward to prevent the waves from breaking,
and the smoother water made it easier for them to see the
small fish below. They seemed to enjoy the gale, and swept
round the yacht gracefully, showing off their white bodies and
dark wings barred with white. They trod the water at intervals
as they ran along it on the tips of their feet, and rode in the
troughs of the waves securely sheltered from the wind. On
August 12th we signalised the day by making a bag, one gull,
but it came as a guest and was entitled to hospitality. It was
apparently tired out, and perched on one of the boats; but when
S. began throwing some meat overboard, with the object of
attracting and photographing the cape pigeons, it joined in the
scramble. The pigeons, however, would have none of the stranger,
and set upon it, whereupon, worsted in the fray, the gull again
sought refuge on the vessel: there it stayed all night, sleeping
quite low down in the folds of some canvas and allowing itself
to be stroked and fed by any passer-by. With the morning,
being rested and refreshed, it flew away.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='large'>ARGENTINA</span></h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>The River Plate—Buenos Aires, its Trade and People.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Argentine Republic is the modern representative of the
Spanish colonies on the east coast of South America, as Brazil is that
of the Portuguese. Fifteen years after the landing of Cabral, Spanish
sailors first sighted the entrance to the Rio Plata, and in 1535
Mendoza established a settlement on the site which later was Buenos
Aires. No gold or silver, however, was to be found, and the Spaniards
looked on their holdings on the South Atlantic merely as a back
door to their richer possessions on the Pacific. Till the eighteenth
century all their South American territories were under the Viceroy
of Peru, and in order to suit the convenience of that colony no ship
was allowed to trade direct with Buenos Aires; all the merchandise
from Europe had to be fetched over the Andes. It was not till the
first richness of the mines was exhausted that attention was drawn
to the grass-covered plains of the east.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Napoleonic wars, which turned Brazil from a colony to an
empire, ultimately led to the establishment of republican rule in
the Spanish colonies. Pitt, however, made a mistake in judging in
1806 that the discontent felt by the younger nation with the rule of
their mother-country would make them unite in the war against her.
He sent an armed force to the River Plate, but his full expectation
that there would be a local rising was grievously disappointed;
Buenos Aires was captured, but the British were subsequently
heavily defeated and obliged to return home. The anniversary of
the “reconquest” is yearly celebrated, and the newly arrived Briton,
who probably never heard of the occurrence, finds that in Argentina
his country is regarded as a defeated nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The loyalty of the colonists to the Crown of Spain was not, however,
of long duration. Seeing that in the old country all authority
was in the melting-pot, a secret society was formed in Buenos Aires,
of which Belgrano was a leading member, to work for representative
government; popular desire for freedom became too strong to be
resisted, and on May 25th, 1810, the viceroy resigned. From that
date the independence of Argentina is officially reckoned. The
Argentines then successfully assisted the revolutionaries of Chile.
Disputes subsequently arose as to the boundary between the two
countries; these differences were referred, at the beginning of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>century, to the Crown of England, which appointed a commission
to deal with the matter, and a treaty was agreed upon in accordance
with its recommendations.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Friday morning, August 15th, land became visible, and by
2 o’clock we were off Flores Island, the entrance to Rio Plata,
where we took up a pilot for its navigation. The river is there
about a hundred miles across, but narrows rapidly, and two hours
later we were opposite Monte Video, where it is only half that
width. Of Monte Video itself we could see only the outline. We
proposed visiting it later by one of the steamers which run there
every night from Buenos Aires, but were discouraged from
doing so by the report that there was nothing whatever to see
except an inferior Buenos Aires, and that the seaside resorts
in the neighbourhood, which were filled in the summer by the
Argentines, would be closed at that time of year. The Plate
River is dull and dreary, having the charm neither of a river nor
of the open sea; it consists of a vast expanse of turbid yellow
water, marked by buoys and the wrecks of ships which have gone
aground on its dangerous shoals. The western bank only was
visible, and that was low-lying, with a suspicion—was it only a
suspicion?—of tall chimneys. We felt that as far as beauty
went we might as well be at the mouth of some English mercantile
river, and certainly, as was remarked, we had much better have
been there from the point of view of getting the needed work
done on the ship. A number of insects of all sorts appeared on
the yacht when we were at least four miles from the shore,
suggesting that, if so many could land on one small ship, many
millions must be blown out to sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>At noon the following day we anchored for a short time, as
the current was too strong for us, and at evening anchored again,
apparently in the middle of nowhere, though with twelve large
vessels as neighbours. We were in reality at the entrance to
the Dredged Channel, where artificial means have had to be
employed to make the river navigable for ships of large draft.
Here it is necessary to pass the quarantine authorities and obtain
a fresh pilot, which formalities being duly complied with, we
proceeded next day on our journey. As it nears the city the
Dredged Channel divides into two; one branch leads to the basin
at the north end of the docks, the other to that at the south end.
The docks at Buenos Aires, instead of being stowed away as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>undesirable excrescence in some remote part of the town, as
is the case in most large seaports, form a frontage of some
three miles to the most important part of the city, and appeal
strongly to both the eye and the imagination. There, in ordered
sequence, not by units—as, for example, at Southampton or
Marseilles—but by hundreds, lie great vessels of all descriptions
from almost every country in Europe; the outward sign of the
great carrying trade between the old country and the new.
They have brought their human freight and cargo of manufactured
goods, and are waiting to return with a food-supply of
livestock and grain. Even these docks are not equal to cope
with the demand for accommodation, for in the grain season as
many as a hundred may be seen in the outer roadstead awaiting
admission, and large extensions were in progress. Argentina is
one of those new lands which stand in the position of rural
estate to older and manufacturing Europe; the supply of food,
which in the earliest stages of the world’s development lay next
each man’s dwelling, and then outside the towns, is now brought
across 7,000 miles of ocean.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little <em>Mana</em> was most kindly welcomed by the port authority,
and awarded a place of honour by the entrance to the North
Basin, which is generally reserved for men-of-war. Here she
appeared elegant but minute, and not being a battleship felt her
position somewhat precarious. The next berth was occupied by
a large emigrant ship, which was German, French, and Italian by
turns, and as the yacht was immediately under the stern it looked
as if, with the least motion, she would be crushed out of existence.
Every time a huge ship went out of the entrance to the harbour,
all on board rushed to the yacht’s deck to see if her bowsprit was
about to be carried away. The manœuvring of the big vessels
by tugs in a limited space is, however, wonderful, and though
we had one or two narrow escapes, either the position was not so
perilous as appeared, or we became accustomed to alarms, for
we finally lived there quite comfortably. We landed either by
boat across the docks, or by scrambling up a wharf like a houseside
by means of a lengthy and somewhat shaky ladder. I have
a vivid mental picture of His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Reginald
Tower, when he was good enough to come and see us, standing
on the top with a little dog, and not unnaturally wondering how
on earth he was expected to descend.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>We lay at Buenos Aires for over a month, refitting and stowing,
before facing the next part of the voyage. We grudged the
delay, but even with the kind help we received there is, as has
already been explained, much time inevitably lost in a new port,
and New Spain, like its European prototype, is essentially
a country of <i><span lang="es">mañana</span></i>. In the end we had to leave without
getting the trouble with the engine put right. The stores sent
ahead from England arrived safely, and through the courtesy
of the Legation we received them custom free, but on some
articles, which were unluckily ordered to come by post—a serge
suit, linen coat, and two washing blouses—we had to pay £4 duty.
I spent a portion of the time in luxury at an hotel while <em>Mana</em>
had a much-needed spring-cleaning. S. lived on board, and I
found on my return had had a good many visitors, whom he
appeared to have enjoyed showing over the yacht with her
hatches up and the floor covered with packing-cases; maintaining,
in reply to my chagrined comments, that the public
were shown over the <i><span lang="la">Terra Nova</span></i> in just such a condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>In such time as could be spared from the work of the Expedition
we saw what we could of the life of the country, and our
observations are given for what they are worth. Unlike Pernambuco
there is no doubt as to the economical <i><span lang="fr">raisons d’être</span></i> of the
Argentine; they are, of course, grain and meat. The area under
cultivation, which we did not see, is steadily increasing, but the
grain export is still far below that of the United States. The
greater part of the mutton supplied to Great Britain comes from
Australia and New Zealand, but the Argentine provides 72 per
cent. of the beef which we receive from abroad, and we were
much interested in seeing something of the cattle industry. We
visited, by the courtesy of the owner, Señor Pereyra, an <i><span lang="fr">estancia</span></i>
about an hour’s journey from Buenos Aires. The train traversed
first the suburbs of a great town, then low country often under
water, and we alighted at a little railway station, from which we
immediately entered the park of the <i><span lang="fr">estancia</span></i>. The estate was
large, though there are others which exceed it; it covers fifteen
square miles, a portion of which is, however, undrained. It has
been in the occupation of the same family for about ninety
years, during which time continual planting has been going on.
The road which led through the park to the house passed under
several fine avenues; the eucalyptus trees of older growth were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>most beautiful, and a revelation of what that tree can attain,
to those who have only seen it in temperate climates or in the
villages and towns of South Africa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dwelling of the owner proved to be a most charming
country house. The dining-room was panelled with oak, displaying
the magnificent collection of silver cups gained by the
stock of the <i><span lang="fr">estancia</span></i>. Our host was in the proud position of
having just won at the cattle show, then being held at Buenos
Aires, the highest awards for both Herefords and Shorthorns.
The competition for such prizes lies in the Argentine between a
limited number of noted breeders, and it is felt well to bring
in a judge from the outside. That year an English gentleman,
well known in connection with the Royal and other shows, had
been requested to act. Eighty thousand Argentine dollars, or
over £7,000 sterling, were paid at this show for a champion bull,
being the highest price yet given for such an animal. After
luncheon we inspected the large farm buildings where the
most valuable of the stock were housed. The remainder of the
cattle, some 7,000 in all, lived in different large enclosures in
various parts of the estate, with a cottage near by for the caretaker.
The owner was assisted by an English and a French
manager, and 260 <i><span lang="co">peons</span></i> or labourers, mostly Italian, were
employed on the <i><span lang="fr">estancia</span></i>. They earn £3 10<em>s.</em> a month, with
practically no expenses, being housed in a row of buildings
with a mess-room in common. There was no lack of labour,
applicants having continually to be turned away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our education was continued by a visit to the market at
Buenos Aires, where anything up to 5,000 head of cattle
are disposed of daily. These are brought from all parts of the
Argentine, and were formerly driven across country. Now, however,
owing to the prevalence of wire fences, they are generally
brought by train. They are confined in open pens, and sold by
auction or otherwise. The cattle auctioneers are men of high
position, and regard themselves as the aristocracy of the city.
The animation of the scene is increased by the number of roughriders
who career on spirited ponies up and down the alley-ways,
looking after the stock and lassoing refractory beasts. No man
connected with the “camp,” as the open country is termed, ever
thinks of walking at any time. The Argentine saddle has special
characteristics, and consists of a pad each side of the spine of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>horse, above and below which rugs are placed, the whole being
covered with a piece of leather and kept in place by girths, thus
forming a most comfortable cushion. The stirrup is so made
that only the toe can go into it, and the whole is calculated to
allow a man to fall clear if he is thrown, a wise precaution in a
land of unbroken mounts. It has also the advantage of providing
excellent bedding, but is of course adapted for a flat country
only, and would be out of place in a mountainous one. A kind
acquaintance, seeing the interest S. took in the saddle, made him
a present of one, which proved invaluable in Easter Island.</p>

<p class='c007'>The majority of the beasts sold at the cattle markets are for
local consumption: those going to the freezing manufactories
are generally bought by private treaty. We were taken over
one of the largest of these <i><span lang="la">frigorificos</span></i>, as they are called, where
some 1,200 cattle and 3,000 sheep are killed daily. Each
animal is inspected from a sanitary point of view on
arrival, and every beast is again examined after it has been
killed. It is skinned and cleaned at the same time, and in
fifteen minutes, from the moment of being slain, is ready in two
sides to hang up in the chilling or freezing chamber. Each of
the sides is subsequently enclosed in a muslin covering ready to
be shipped. The hides are, of course, also a most valuable commodity,
and the fat is subjected to pressure, the oil being used
for cooking purposes and the solid residue for candle-making.
The unused portion of the beast is turned into guano. Some of
the meat is reserved for canning, and the tinned goods are
particularly attractive. Each tin is closed save for one small
hole at the top, and is then passed into a vacuum pump,
which extracts the air and closes the hole with an electric needle.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very determined set was being made to bring all the
Argentine <i><span lang="la">frigorificos</span></i> into the American meat trust; those
which, like the one we visited, are determined to resist have to
fight hard to hold their position. There was a loud outcry with
regard to the increase in the price of meat, which had gone up
retail to about sevenpence a pound; but buying through a ship’s
chandler, who could obtain it for wholesale prices, we were able to
purchase at a lower rate. The prices for tinned meat were much
the same as in England. Salt meat we were warned to avoid, as it
could not be guaranteed for more than two months, though the
remainder of our stock that had been put on board in England,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>ten months before, was still in excellent condition. Every
attempt, we were told, had been made to discover the reason for
this failure, which is common to all meat south of the Equator;
the services of experts from Europe had been requisitioned, the
method, the meat, the salt, and the water had all been carefully
examined, but so far without result.</p>

<p class='c007'>The city of Buenos Aires itself, of which the docks have
already been described, is simply a glorified port for this trade,
and for the produce of a wealthy hinterland. The old part of
the town, in which all business is transacted and which most
impresses itself on the memory, is a labyrinth, or rather chess-board,
of terribly narrow streets. The thoroughfares are at
right angles, and the houses, which are in regular blocks, are
all precisely similar in appearance; nothing, therefore, but an
exact knowledge of the names and orders of the numerous streets
as they lie in each direction of the chess-board can enable a
stranger to find his way. The same street extends for miles, and
he who forgets the number of his destination may as well give
up the search. So narrow are these thoroughfares that two
persons can only just pass on the pavement, and there is imminent
danger of being pushed under the trams which run within fifteen
inches of the curb. Traffic is only allowed in one direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a town which has never been walled, and where space was
no object, such a state of things is surprising; the original construction
is said to have been due to the desire to obtain a
maximum of shade, and any alteration now is of course fraught
with much difficulty. Great efforts are, however, being made to
render the Argentine capital worthy of its wealth and position.
An imposing avenue, with the House of Congress at one end, has
been cleared at great cost. The more recent portion of the
town boasts good squares and parks, for the network of streets
is but the hub of a huge and quickly growing city. Underground
railways are being constructed, but so rapid is the extension
of Buenos Aires that it is said they will only relieve the
traffic for eleven years. The general impression of a bustling sea
port with a southern element recalls Marseilles, but it has not
the same beauty of situation. Buenos Aires has been called “a
horrible travesty of Paris,” but perhaps the most correct description
is that which styles it “a mixture of Paris and New
York.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Of what description are the people in whose hands lie the
development of this country, with its growing influence on the
destinies of the world? The new-comer arriving from the north
is at once struck with the distinction between Brazil and the
Argentine. Rio, with its strain of dark descent living in the midst
of a dream of sleepy beauty, is still perhaps partly mediæval
and undoubtedly tropical; Buenos Aires, on its flat plain and
dreary river, is awake, twentieth century, and wholly European;
but it is to the south of Europe that the Argentine is akin and
not to the north. A Latin race was the first to colonise the new
land, and successive waves of the same are still reaching its
shores. In 1911 the immigrants from Spain, Italy, and France
numbered nearly 2,000,000, as against 13,000 from Britain and
7,000 from Germany. Many Italians, it is true, come only
for one harvest, or possibly for two, returning for the busy
season in their own homes. The wages earned are such that
the more idle are in a position to disdain all other work, and
a crowd of loiterers round the docks, who appeared to us to
be unemployed of the usual character, turned out to be agricultural
workers living on their own resources till the next
harvest. Many, however, of these immigrants settle in the new
land, by the law of which every child born in the country becomes
<i><span lang="la">ipso facto</span></i> an Argentine subject. It is perhaps because of this
comparatively uniform origin that an Argentine type seems
to be already developing. It is fundamentally that of Southern
Europe, but it is moulded by a new environment, is wide-awake
and energetic, with an absence of all mystery and tradition,
but alive to the finger-tips. The practical aspect of life is the
dominant note, whether for the native or temporary resident.
“We are all here to make money,” the stranger is frankly
informed, “and we talk of nothing else.” No apology shall
therefore be made for once more referring to the question of
pounds, shillings, and pence, for in South America it is impossible
to get away from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cost of living in Buenos Aires is two or three times as
high as that of London in normal times. At the best hotel,
usually frequented by European travellers, the smallest bedroom
cannot be obtained under eighteen shillings a night, and even
at the less dear hotels, resorted to by those to whom expense
is an object, the ordinary price for dinner is five dollars or 8<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“One thinks a good deal in England of a £5 note,” was the
remark to us of one Argentine; “here one never goes out without
a fifty-dollar note (between £4 and £5) in one’s pocket.” Rents
are enormous, and a would-be purchaser told us ruefully that
he could not obtain in the suburbs a house with three sitting
and four bedrooms, on a plot of ground some thirty yards square,
under £15,000. All this falls hardly on the visitor or foreign
official, but it affects the resident but little; an 8 per cent. investment
is looked upon as reasonable and cautious, and for the
working classes wages are proportionately high. The temporary
immigrant who wishes to go back to Europe saves most of the
money by living under very meagre conditions; thus two or
three Italians frequently join together in one room at about
half the rate paid by less thrifty workmen. Most visitors to
Southern Europe are acquainted with the little mansions, built
in the villages of their birth, by natives who have returned with
modest fortunes from the Argentine, and this is the process by
which that wealth is accumulated. More rapid roads are occasionally
found to success. Our Sailing-master was acquainted
with a former gaol-warder who went out as an emigrant from
Southampton; his wife joined him, but came back before long,
saying little but that her husband was also returning. In less
than two years the man was back with a competency for the
rest of his days, the source of which continued to be veiled in
mystery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Science, literature, and art do not as yet thrive very largely
in Argentina, though exception must be made for the very
interesting museum at La Plata, whose director was most kind
in affording information to the Expedition. The great recreation
is racing, in addition to which the inhabitants are all born
gamblers. Sir Reginald Tower, to whose kind arrangements for
us we owe much of the interest of our time in Buenos Aires, was
good enough to take us to a race meeting, and we were greatly
impressed with the lavish arrangements for the comforts of the
spectators. It was also most pleasant to be spared all cries of
the bookmakers—the betting system is that of the <i><span lang="la">pari mutuel</span></i>.
The Jockey Club is the most important social club, and with
an entrance fee of nearly £300 is naturally extremely wealthy;
its existing premises are palatial, and even so the removal to
larger ones was under consideration. We were kindly entertained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>there by a distinguished representative of the early Spanish
stock, Señor Calvo, to whom we were introduced while he was
practising his profession of auctioneer at the cattle-market.
His ancestor was a viceroy of the Court of Spain, and he is by
descent on both sides a pure Spaniard; the cosmopolitan influences
of to-day have, however, been too strong for the continuance
of this tradition in the family, and he himself and other
members of it have allied with outside nationalities. His father,
who was responsible for the conduct of a public journal, had
his life attempted three times by his political enemies, and finally
sought refuge in England. There the son was born and educated,
but later on, going out to the Argentine, he too entered
public life and became a member of Congress, whose buildings
it was most interesting to see under his guidance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The life of Argentine women is almost that of the East. The
men go their own way, make their own acquaintances, live their
own life. They ask strangers but little to their homes, and it is
possible to be on quite intimate terms with an Argentine and
unaware whether he is married or single. Country house hospitality
scarcely exists, and even on the large <i><span lang="fr">estancias</span></i> in the
neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, a week-end party is unknown.
A lady does not walk out alone, and never, even in her own
home, receives a male guest without the presence of her husband.
We have been credibly informed of a wife who boasted that
during her husband’s absence in Europe, of over a year, she
never went out of the house. There is no higher education for
women except for those training professionally, and the interests
of the majority, like those of a certain set at home in pre-war
days, consist mainly in bridge and dress. Forty years ago all
women wore the mantilla, but to-day fabulous sums are spent
on clothes. One charming Argentine lady told me that £30 was
quite a usual sum to give for a smart but simple hat. At the
seaside resorts the expenditure on clothes is so lavish, that it is
cheaper to take the trip to Europe than to procure the necessary
garments in which to be seen among your friends. In appearance
the women are pretty and effective, but spoilt to the
eyes of a European by the inordinate amount of powder. I
was told by one present at the dinner-party in question of an
amusing scene witnessed in the ladies’ cloak-room; a daughter
arriving with her mother called out, “Oh, Mother, you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>not nearly enough powder on,” and made a dash for the powderpuff
to remedy with two or three large splashes the supposed
defect. It is said that the wave of female emancipation is
reaching South America, but doubt was expressed by a keen
observer whether it would necessarily take its European form
of a demand for political and legal rights, or whether the Argentine
woman would not begin by desiring the same social and
matrimonial liberty as is assumed by her husband. At present,
unfortunately, with the vicious circle in which such customs
move, much of the precaution taken to guard women appears
to be necessary, and I was sadly informed by more than one
English girl employed in the business houses of Buenos Aires,
that the freedom with which young women can move and conduct
themselves at home was not only conventionally but actually
impossible in their new surroundings.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Argentina, as the depository of much that is undesirable
from other nations, can hardly hope to escape the blackguard
element. Assassination is the only thing which is cheap in the
South American continent. The head of one of the seamen’s
missions at Buenos Aires told S. that it was possible at any time
to procure the murder of a man by paying five dollars, not quite
ten shillings, in the right quarters: this was somewhat less than
at Rio, where the price was stated to be thirteen shillings and
fourpence. The scenes which occur nightly about the docks are
incredible; hence returning to <em>Mana</em> after dark was always a
matter of some anxiety. Our steward received a typewritten
letter saying that he had been mentioned as a suitable man for
a desirable situation, and giving an appointment after dark at
a certain house in a certain street. On inquiry the address
turned out to be that of a low street in the new part of the town,
where much land is still waste, and there was no house yet
built of the number given. With regard to the said steward,
one Sunday evening he left the yacht and never returned. All
anxiety about his fate was set at rest by the fact that he had
cleared his cabin of all his goods. He may have been homesick
and arranged to work his passage back, or he may have been
enticed by a more substantial offer, a very usual occurrence where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>trained servants are difficult to obtain. As he had of course
signed the ship’s articles for the trip, his desertion was reported
to the consulate and the police, but we were told that to get
him back would be practically an impossibility; while, scruples
apart, nothing would have been gained by the simpler method of
assassination. The man himself we did not regret, but after the
manner of his kind he had waited till we were on the point of
sailing, and therefore left us in the lurch.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of the fact that personal safety still leaves a good deal
to be desired, the Government of Argentina is one of the purest
in South America; the result, it is said, of the wealth of her
officials. She is already proudly conscious of her strength, and,
in some quarters at any rate, is anxious to rely upon it alone
for her position among nations rather than on any such external
aid as the Monroe doctrine. Throughout the whole continent
it is necessary in speaking of the citizens of the United States
to term them carefully “North Americans,” avoiding the usual
and more abbreviated form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Religion is not a powerful factor in Argentina either in public
or private life. Roman Catholicism is officially recognised, but
it does not strive to be a political force, and meets therefore
with general toleration; even when it is not practised it is neither
hated nor feared. Many women and some men are devout, but
the majority of men simply ignore it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Briton in leaving Argentina not unnaturally asks what
is the share of his own countrymen in the development of the
new republic. Our connection with it through trade is considerable.
The railways are in British hands, and 61 per cent.
of the shipping flies the Union Jack. In addition to young men
who may wish to take up life in “the camp,” or country, a certain
number of Englishmen are employed in offices and professional
positions, while in connection with retail trade, it is homelike to
see the shops and advertisements of such firms as Harrod and
Maple. A pleasing bond exists throughout the British colony in
Freemasonry, which is a most living force, with many adherents,
amongst whom our Minister is included. S. being one of the
elect, we had, through the kindness of Mr. Chevalier Boutell, the
Deputy Grand Master for South America, the pleasure of being
present at a ladies’ banquet, which proved a very brilliant and
enjoyable entertainment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>While the English commercial position is still good, it is said
that forty years ago our proportion of the trade was even greater.
An old inhabitant told us that he knew personally of not less
than twenty-five British firms who had gone under during that
period, owing to the dogged incapacity of the Englishman to
supply what his customer wanted, instead of what he himself
chose to provide. Such failures leave, of course, the door open
for German penetration. A reputation for the same want of
adaptability, and also for being given to drink, makes Englishmen
unpopular as employés. With regard to our women kind, certain
posts in the town which are open to English girls are well paid,
but they should be taken up in every case with the greatest
caution, and the remuneration offered carefully compared with
the increased cost of living. A woman who marries on to an
<i><span lang="fr">estancia</span></i> is necessarily comparatively isolated, and accounts
differed as to the amount of help she is able to obtain in
domestic labour. The 30,000 British subjects who form the
whole of those resident in Argentina are, in any case, but
a drop in the ocean, and they but seldom identify themselves
with the country of their abode. It is not unusual for parents
to arrange that their children shall be born in England, in order
that they may avoid registration as citizens of the Republic,
with its consequent liability to military service. It has been
proposed in high quarters that suitable accommodation might
be provided in the Falkland Islands, as nearer and more convenient
British soil. Failing some such arrangement it is
possible to register a child of British parentage which is born in
Argentina, at the national consulate, and it is then <i><span lang="fr">ipso facto</span></i>
a British subject, except when actually in the land where it
first saw the light. Whatever share Britain may have in developing
the wealth of Argentina, that country never has
been, and never will be, connected with us by blood; for that
bond with new lands we must look to our own dominions over
the seas.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most southerly portion of the South American continent,
called Patagonia, first became known in the endeavour to find a new
way into the Pacific. Magellan was commissioned by Charles of
Spain to try to find by the south that ocean passage to the Indies
which Columbus had sought in vain further north. He sailed in
August 1519, and began his search along the coast at the River
Plate; on October 21st, the day of the Eleven Thousand Virgins,
he came in sight of a large channel opening out to the west: the
promontory to the north of this channel still bears the name he
bestowed of Cape Virgins. He proceeded cautiously, sending boats
ahead to explore, and on November 28th entered the Pacific. When
he saw the open sea he is said to have wept for joy, and christened
the last cape “Deseado,” or the “Desired.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sea power of England, which had been negligible in the time
of the first voyages to the New World, was growing in strength; and,
though she had attempted no settlement on the southern continent,
she saw no reason to acquiesce in the edicts of the King of Spain,
shutting her off from all trade with the New World. In 1578 Drake
took Magellan’s route, with the object of intercepting galleons on
the Pacific coast, and passed through the Straits in sixteen days.
On entering the Pacific he was blown backward towards Cape Horn,
and was the first to realise that there was another waterway, yet
further south, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Up till this time the
land had been supposed to extend to the Antarctic.</p>

<p class='c008'>A hundred years later Charles II of England sent an expedition
under Sir John Narborough to explore this part of the world and
trade with the Indians, which wintered on the eastern coast of
Patagonia.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anson’s squadron avoided the Straits, taking the way by the Horn.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Chilean and Argentine Boundary Commission divided Patagonia
between the two countries, giving the west and south to Chile
and bisecting Tierra del Fuego, 1902.</p>

<p class='c006'>We left Buenos Aires on September 19th, achieving the descent
of the river without a pilot, and for the next fortnight had a
varying share of fair winds, contrary winds, and calms. Our
chief interest was the man who had taken the place of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>absconding steward, who shall be known as “Freeman”; we
heard of him through a seamen’s home, and arranged that he
should go with us to Punta Arenas, to which place he wished for a
passage. He was a clean-looking “Britisher,” who for the
last seven years had been knocking about South America. He
brought with him a gramophone, and a Parabellum automatic
pistol, with which he proved an excellent shot, and he made it
a <i><span lang="la">sine qua non</span></i> that we should find room on board for his saddle;
thus was my knowledge increased of the necessary equipment
of an indoor servant. We paid him at the rate of £100 a year,
and though we found that he could neither boil a suet pudding
nor lay a table, so enlightening were his accounts of up-country
life that we did not grudge him the money.</p>

<p class='c007'>We flatter ourselves our experience in detecting mendacity
would qualify us as police-court magistrates, but we never saw
any reason to doubt the substantial accuracy of Freeman’s
stories. His experience dated back to the time when mares of
two or three years old were sold for ten shillings, or were boiled
down for fat, as, after the Spanish fashion, no man would demean
himself by riding one. He had at one time ridden across the
continent from the Patagonian to the Chilean coast, a journey of
six weeks, half of which time he never saw a human being; he
was followed all the way by a dog, though the poor animal was
once two or three days without water; it got left behind at
times, but always managed to pick up his trail. He was most
candid about the means by which he had made money when
at one time employed on the railway, for honesty was not in
his opinion the way that the game was played in South America,
and therefore no individual could afford to make it part of his
programme; it did happen to be one of the rules on <em>Mana</em>, and
we never knew him break it. He was once running away after
some drunken escapade, when a policeman appeared and took
pot-shots at him with a rifle. Freeman turned and dropped him
with his revolver; he did it the more reluctantly as he knew
and liked the man. Happily the shot was not fatal, and he
felt convinced that he himself had not been recognised.</p>

<p class='c007'>After, therefore, carefully arranging an alibi elsewhere he
returned, condoled with the victim on the lawless deed, and
gave him what assistance he could; he felt, however, that that
part of the country had become not very “healthy,” and subsequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>moved on. Even our experiences of the ports had
scarcely prepared us for the cynical indifference to human life
which his experiences incidentally revealed as an every-day affair
in “the camp.” In sparsely inhabited districts, with their very
recent population, the factors are absent through which primitive
societies generally secure justice, clans do not exist, families are
the exception, and in almost every case a man is simply a unit.
The more advanced methods of keeping the peace have either not
been formed or are not effective, for crime is often connived at
by the authorities themselves. The result is that the era of
vendetta and private revenge seems civilised in comparison with
a state of things where no notice is taken of murder, and the
victim who falls in a brawl or by fouler means simply disappears
unknown and unmissed, while the murderer goes scot-free to
repeat his crime on the next occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Freeman had, <i><span lang="la">inter alia</span></i>, been employed on one of the farms
in Patagonia, along the coast of which we were sailing, and told
tales of the pumas, or South American lions, which abounded
in a certain neighbourhood. This district had railway connection
with a little anchorage known as Port Desire, and as
one of our intervals in harbour was now due S. arranged to turn
in here, and go up-country with him to try to get a shot at the
animals. We therefore put into the port on October 3rd. It
is a small inlet, of which the surrounding country is covered with
grass, but flat and dreary in the extreme, the only relief being
a distant vision of blue hills. Sir John Narborough, who spent
part of the winter here in 1670, said he never saw in the country
“a stick of wood large enough to make the handle of a hatchet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The human dwellings are a few tin shanties. In a walk on
shore we were able to see in a gully, a few remains of the walls
of the old Spanish settlement. As to the puma, fortunately
from its point of view, the railway service left a good deal to be
desired. We arrived on Friday, and there turned out to be no
train till the following Tuesday, so it lived to be shot another
day—unless indeed it met a more ignominious end, for the
South American lion is so unworthy of its name that it is sometimes
killed by being ridden down and brained with a stirrup-iron.
We took three sheep on board, as mutton at twopence a
pound appealed to the housekeeping mind, and were able to secure
some water, which is brought down by rail; it was a relief to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>our tanks well supplied, as the ports further down the coast are
defended by bars, and would have been difficult of access in bad
weather. Drake, on whose course we were now entering, selected
St. Julian, the next bay to the southward, for his port of call
before entering the Straits of Magellan; it was there he had
trouble with his crew, and was obliged to hang Doughty.</p>

<p class='c007'>We sailed from Port Desire on Monday morning, but were
not to say good-bye to it so speedily. We soon encountered
a strong head wind, with the result that Wednesday evening
found us fifteen miles backwards on a return journey to Buenos
Aires, and the whole of Thursday saw us still within sight of
it. We amused ourselves by discussing the voyage, which had
now lasted more than seven months. One of the company
declared that he had lost all sense of time and felt like a native
or an animal: things just went on from day to day; there was
neither before nor after, neither early nor late. It did not, he
said, seem very long since we left Falmouth, but on the other
hand our stay at Pernambuco was certainly in the remote past,
and so with everything else. We had now, in fact, done about
three-quarters of the distance from Buenos Aires towards the
Straits of Magellan, and had 300 miles left before we reached
their entrance at Cape Virgins.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ever since the Expedition was originally projected the passage
of the Straits had been spoken of in somewhat hushed
tones; but now, when with a more favourable wind we began
to approach them, instead of going into Arctic regions, as
some of us had anticipated, the weather improved, the sun went
south faster than we did, and the days lengthened rapidly. Our
numerous delays had at least one fortunate result—they secured
us a much better time of year in the Straits than we had expected
would fall to our lot. The feeling in the air was that of an
English April, bright and sunny, but fresh; we kept the saloon
cold on principle during the daytime, living in big coats; in the
evening we had on the hot-water apparatus, so as to go warm
to bed. It was quite possible to write on deck, and the sea
was almost too beautifully calm. We had a great many ocean
callers, who seemed attracted by the vessel: porpoises tumbled
about the bows till we could nearly stroke them, a whale would
go round and round the yacht, coming up to blow at intervals,
while seals reared their heads and shoulders out of the waters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and looked at us in a way that was positively bewitching; once
a whale and seal paid us a visit at the same time. One night S.,
who was keeping a watch for one of the officers who was indisposed,
was interested in watching the gulls still feeding during
the dark hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 10 p.m. on October 15th the light of Cape Virgins was
sighted, and we woke to find ourselves actually in the Straits
of Magellan. The Magellan route, as compared with that by
the Horn, is not only a short road from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
cutting off the islands to the south of the continent, but ensures
calm waters, instead of the stupendous seas of the Antarctic
Ocean. For a sailing ship, however, the difficulties are great; the
prevailing wind is from the west, and there is no space for a large
vessel to beat up against it, nor does she gain the advantage that
can be derived from any slight shift of wind; outside the gale
may vary a point or two, but within the channel it always blows
straight down as in a gully. The early mariners could overcome
these obstacles through the strength of their crews; in
case of necessity they lowered their boats and towed the ship, but
the vessels of the present no longer carry sufficient men to make
such a proceeding possible. Sailing-ships therefore take to-day
the Cape Horn route, in spite of its well-known delays, trials, and
hardships. When later the German cruiser turned up at Easter
Island with her captured crews, the great regret of the latter was
that they had been taken just too late, after they had gone
through the unpleasantness of the passage round the Horn.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first sight of Tierra del Fuego is certainly disappointing.
The word calls up visions of desolate snowy mountains inhabited
by giants; what is seen are low cliffs, behind which are rolling
downs, sunny and smiling, divided up into prosaic sheep farms.
A reasonably careful study of the map would of course have
shown what was to be expected, as on the Atlantic coast the
plains continue to the extreme south of the continent, while the
chain of the Andes looks only on to the Pacific. Nevertheless,
if not thrilling, it was at least enjoyable to be in a stretch of
smooth water, with Patagonia on the north and Tierra del Fuego
on the south. The land on either hand is excellent pasture for
sheep, and there is said to be sometimes as much as 97 per cent.
increase in a flock. The largest owners are one or two Chilean
firms, but the shepherds employed are almost all Scotsmen, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>indeed the scenery recalls some of the less beautiful districts
in the Highlands. When sheep-farming was established, the
Indians, not unnaturally from their point of view, made raids
on the new animals, with the result that the representatives of
the company were consumed with wrath at seeing their stock
eaten by lazy natives; they started a campaign of extermination,
shooting at sight and offering a reward for Indian tongues. Our
friend Freeman had worked on one of the farms, which had a
stock of 200,000 sheep, and the information he gave on this
head was fully confirmed later in conversations at Punta Arenas.
The destruction of the Indians was spoken of there as a matter
for regret, but as rendered inevitable by circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>The navigation through the straits of a craft like ours makes
it necessary to anchor in the dark hours: the first night we spent
off the Fuegian coast, in sight of one of the pillars which define
the boundary of Chile and Patagonia; the second we lay in
Possession Bay, which is on the Patagonian side. We had time
at the latter anchorage to examine the pathetic wreck of a
steamer, which had gone aground. She was a paddle-boat,
which was being towed presumably from one lake or river area
to another, and had to be cut adrift. Even in such an unheroic
vessel it was touching to see the sign of departed and luxurious
life cast away on this lonely shore, stained-glass doors bearing the
inscription of “smoking” or “dining-room,” and good mahogany
fittings such as washing-stands still in place. It is said that the
outer coast is strewn with wrecks containing valuable articles
which it is worth no one’s while to remove. S. walked up to the
neighbouring lighthouse, and was presented with three rhea
eggs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The next morning we were under way at 5 o’clock, in order
to pass with the correct tide through what are known as the
First Narrows. The current here is so strong that it would have
been impossible for us to make headway against it; as it was,
the wind sank soon after we started, and we only just accomplished
the passage, anchoring in St. Jago Bay. The following
day, Sunday, we negotiated successfully the Second Narrows.
From our next anchorage we saw from the yacht several rhea,
or South American ostriches, on a small promontory. S. went
ashore on the point and shot two of them, while Mr. Ritchie and
Mr. Gillam, who had landed on the neck of the promontory,
endeavoured to cut off the retreat of the two remaining birds.
The one marked by Mr. Ritchie went through some water and
escaped him; the onlookers then viewed with much interest a
duel between Mr. Gillam on the one hand, running about in
sea-boots armed with a revolver, and the last ostrich on the
other, vigorously using its legs and wings and on its own ground.
Victory remained with the bird, which reached the mainland
triumphantly, or at least disappeared behind a bush and was
no more seen. Seven miles south-west of the Second Narrows
lies Elizabeth Island, so named by Drake. We took the passage
known as Queen’s Road on the Fuegian side of the island, and
reached Punta Arenas next afternoon, Monday, October 20th.
We had intended to be there for two or three days only, but fate
willed otherwise, and we sat for weeks in a tearing wind among
small crests of foam, gazing at a little checkered pattern of houses
on the open hillside opposite.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that the motor engine, to our great
chagrin, was practically useless through heated bearings, and
that all our endeavours at Buenos Aires to diagnose and
remedy its ailment had been ineffectual. We had consequently
to rely on passing through the Straits either under
sail, or, as the late Lord Crawford had suggested to us
before starting, through getting a tow from some passing
tramp by means of a £50 cheque to the skipper, a transaction
which would probably not appear in their log. However,
in mentioning our disappointment to the British Consul,
who was one of an engineering firm, he and his partner hazarded
the suggestion that the defect lay, not in the engine, where it
had been sought, but in the installation; that the shaft was
probably not “true.” They bravely undertook the job of overhauling
it on the principle of “no cure, no pay,” and were entirely
justified by the result. The alteration was to have been finished
in ten days, but there were the usual delays, one of which was
a strike at the “shops,” when a piece of work could only be
continued by inducing one man to ply his trade behind closed
doors while S. turned the lathe. It was six weeks before the
anxious moment finally came for the eight hours’ trial, which
had been part of the bargain, but the motor did it triumphantly
without turning a hair. We found what consolation for the
delay was possible in the reflection that we had at least done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>all in our power to guard against such misfortune. The engine
had been purchased from a first-class firm who had done the
installation; the work had been supervised on our behalf by a
private firm and passed by Lloyds; nevertheless it was peculiarly
aggravating, for not only did it involve great money loss, but it
sacrificed some of the strictly limited time of our navigator and
geologist. We had the pleasure at this time of welcoming the
said geologist, Mr. Lowry-Corry, who now joined the Expedition
after successfully completing his work in India.</p>

<p class='c007'>Punta Arenas, with which we became so well acquainted, is a
new and unpretentious little town, but it is the centre of the
sheep-grazing districts, and its shops are remarkably good. Anything
in reason can be purchased there, and on the whole at more
moderate prices than elsewhere in South America. The beautiful
part of the Straits is not yet reached, and save for some distant
views the place is ugly, but it gives a sensation of cleanliness and
fresh air, and our detention might have been worse. There is
indeed, on occasion, too much air, for it was at times impossible
to get from the ship to the shore or <i><span lang="la">vice versa</span></i>, and if members
of the party were on land when the wind sprang up they had to
spend the night at the little hotel; the waves were not big, but
the gales were too strong for the men to pull against them. I
was with reluctance obliged to give up some promising Spanish
lessons, with which I had hoped to occupy the time, for it was
impossible to be sure of keeping any appointment from the
yacht. Punta Arenas boasts an English chaplain, and Boy
Scouts are in evidence. The chief celebrity is an Arctic spidercrab,
which multiplies in the channels and is delicious eating,
but we never discovered anything of much local interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>I made one day a vain attempt to find the graves of the
officers and crew of H.M.S. <em>Dotterel</em>, which was blown up off
Sandy Point some thirty years ago. The cemetery overlooked
the Straits; it was desolate and dreary, the ground being unlevelled
and the tufted grass, with which it was covered, unkept
and unmown. Most of the graves were humble enclosures, some
of which gave the impression of greenhouses, being covered with
erections of wood and glass; but here and there were small
mausoleums, the property of rich families or corporations. It
is the custom with some Chileans so to preserve the remains
that the faces continue visible; an Englishman at Santiago
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>told us that after a funeral which he had attended, the mourners
expressed a desire to “see Aunt Maria,” whereupon the coffin of
a formerly deceased relative was taken down from its niche for
her features to be inspected. The police of Punta Arenas had
their home together in a large vault, which was apparently
being prepared for a new occupant; while the veterans of ’79
(the war between Chile and Peru) slept as they had fought, side
by side. There was apparently no Protestant corner, for the
graves of English, Germans, and Norwegians were intermingled
with those of Chileans. The resting-places of all, rich and poor
alike, were lovingly decorated with the metal wreaths so prevalent
in Latin countries, but unattractive to the English eye. Whilst
I wandered among the tombs a storm burst, which had been
gathering for some time amongst distant mountains, and chilly
flakes of snow swept down in force, with biting wind and hail.
I sheltered in the lee of a mausoleum, on whose roof balanced
a large figure of the angel of peace bearing the palm-branch of
victory, and the inscription on which showed it to be the property
of a wealthy family, whose name report specially connected
with the poisoning of Indians. The landscape was temporarily
obscured by the driving storm, not a soul was in sight, and the
iron wreaths on hundreds of graves rattled with a weird and
ghostly sound. Presently, however, the tempest passed and
the sun shone out, while over the Straits, towards the Fuegian
land, there came out in the sky a wonderful arc of light edged
by the colours of the rainbow, which turned the sea at its foot
into a translucent and sparkling green.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if there was not much occupation on shore, the unexpected
length of our stay provided us unpleasantly with domestic
employment. We had on arrival parted from our friend
Freeman, his object in coming to Punta Arenas was, it transpired,
to collect the remainder of a sum due to him in connection
with the sale of a skating-rink, which he had at one time started
there and run with considerable success: we were proud to
think that service on an English scientific vessel would now be
added to his experiences. Life below deck was then in the hands
of Luke, the under-steward, who, as will be remembered by careful
readers, had been the salvation of the inner man during our first
gale in the North Atlantic. We had engaged him at Southampton
on the strength of a character from a liner on which he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>served in some subordinate capacity, and he signed on for the
voyage of three years at the rate of £2 10<em>s.</em> a month. Though
never what registry offices would call “clean in person and
work,” he plodded through somehow, and again in the Freeman
episode rescued the ship from starvation; we accordingly doubled
his wages as a testimonial of esteem. My feelings can therefore
be imagined when one morning, after we had been some weeks
at Punta Arenas, I was told that Luke was not on board and
his cabin was cleared. He had somehow in the early morning
eluded the anchor watch and had gone off in a strange boat.
A deserter forfeits of course his accumulated wages, which,
by a probably wise regulation, are payable to Government and
not to the owner; but there is nothing to prevent a man who
is leaving a vessel recouping himself by means of any little
articles that he may judge will come in handy in his new career.
The one that I grudged most to Luke was my cookery book, to
which he had become much attached, and which was never seen
again after his departure; it was really a mean theft, from which
I suffered much in the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>S. offered, through the police, a reward for his detention, and
enlarged his knowledge of the town by going personally through
every low haunt, but without success. A rumour subsequently
reached us that a muffled figure had been seen going on board
one of the little steamers which plied backwards and forwards
to the ports in Tierra del Fuego, and we heard, when it was too
late, that Luke had been enticed to a sheep farm there, with
the promise of permanent employment at £10 a month, with £2
bonus during shearing-time, which was then in progress. The
temptation was enormous, and I have to this day a sneaking
kindliness for Luke, but for those who tempted him no pardon at
all. The condition in which the successive defaulters had left
their quarters is better pictured than described, and so stringent
is the line of ship’s etiquette between work on deck and below,
that, as the simplest way and for the honour of the yacht, the
Stewardess did the job of cleaning out cabin and pantry herself.
The moral for shipowners is—do not dally in South American
ports.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Now began a strange hunt in the middle of nowhere for
anything that could call itself a cook or steward. The beachcombers
who applied were marvellous; one persistent applicant
was the pianist at the local cinema; our expedition, as already
discovered, had a certain romantic sound, which was apt to
attract those who had by no means always counted the cost.
Mail steamers pass Punta Arenas every fortnight, once a month
in each direction, and these we now boarded with the tale of our
woes. Both captain and purser were most kind in allowing us
to ask for a volunteer among the stewards, but the attempt was
only temporarily successful; the routine work of a big vessel
under constant supervision proved not the right training for such
a post as ours.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, we were told of a British cook who had been left
in hospital by a merchant ship passing through the Straits.
The cause of his detention was a broken arm, obtained in fighting
on board; this hardly seemed promising, but the captain was
reported to have said that he was “sorry to lose him,” and we
were only too thankful to get hold of anything with some sort of
recommendation. On the whole Bailey was a success. He too
had knocked about the world; at one time he had made money
over a coffee-and-cake stall in Australia, and then thrown it away.
We had our differences of course; he once, for instance, told me
that as cook he took “a superior position on the ship’s books
to the stewardess,” but his moments of temper soon blew over.
I shall always cherish pleasant memories of the way in which
he and I stood by one another for weeks and months in a
position of loneliness and difficulty; but this is anticipating.</p>

<p class='c007'>As departure drew near, provisioning for the next stage became
a serious business, as, with the exception of a few depots for shipwrecked
mariners, there was no possibility of obtaining anything
after we sailed, before we reached our Chilean destination of
Talcahuano. S.’s work was more simple, as he had only to fill
up to the greatest extent with coal and oil, knowing that at the
worst the channels provide plenty of wood and water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next few weeks, when we traversed the remainder of
the Magellan Straits and the Patagonian Channels, were the
most fascinating part of the voyage. The whole of this portion
of South America is a bewildering labyrinth of waterways and
islands; fresh passages open up from every point of view, till
the voyager longs to see what is round the corner, not in one
direction, but in all. It has, too, much of the charm of the
unknown: such charts as exist have been made principally by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>four English men-of-war at different periods, the earliest being
that of the <em>Beagle</em>, in the celebrated voyage in which Darwin
took part. A large portion of the ways and inlets are, however,
entirely unexplored. The effect of both straits and channels
is best imagined by picturing a Switzerland into whose valleys
and gorges the sea has been let in; above tower snow-clad
peaks, while below precipices, clothed with beautiful verdure, go
straight down to the water’s edge. The simile of a sea-invaded
Alps is indeed fairly accurate, for this is the tail of the Andes
which has been partially submerged. The mountains do not
rise above 5,000 feet, but the full benefit of the height is
obtained as they are seen from the sea-level. The permanent
snow-line is at about 1,200 feet. The depths are very great,
being in some places as much as 4,000 feet, and the only places
where it is possible to anchor are in certain little harbours
where there is a break in the wall of rock. These anchorages
lie anything from five miles to twenty or thirty miles apart,
and as it was impossible to travel at night it was essential to
reach one of them before dark. If for any reason it did not
prove feasible to accomplish the necessary distance, there was
no option but to turn back in time to reach the last resting-place
before daylight failed, and start again on the next suitable day.
On the other hand, when things were propitious, we were able on
occasion to reach an even further harbour than the one which
had been planned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proceeding amusingly resembled a game, played in the
days of one’s youth, with dice on a numbered board, and
entitled “Willie’s Walk to Grandmamma”: the player might not
start till he had thrown the right number, and even when he
had begun his journey he might, by an unlucky cast, find that
he was “stopping to play marbles” and lose a turn, or be obliged
to go back to the beginning; if, however, he were fortunate he
might pass, like an express train, through several intermediate
stopping-places, and outdistance all competitors. The two
other sailing yachts with whose record we competed were
the <em>Sunbeam</em> in 1876 and the <em>Nyanza</em> in 1888: the match was
scarcely a fair one, as the <em>Sunbeam</em> had strong steam power and
soon left us out of sight, while the <em>Nyanza</em>, though a much bigger
vessel, had no motor, and we halved her record.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen that it was of first-rate importance to make the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>most of the hours of daylight, which were now at their longest,
and to effect as early a start as possible, so that in case of accident
or delay we should have plenty of time in hand before dark.
We therefore, long before such became fashionable, passed a
summer-time bill of a most extended character, the clock being
put five hours forward. Breakfast was really at 3 a.m., and we
were under way an hour later, when it was broad daylight; but
as the hours were called eight and nine everyone felt quite comfortable
and as usual, it was a great success. The difficulty lay
in retiring proportionately early. Stevenson’s words continually
rose to mind: “In summer quite the other way—I have to go
to bed by day.” The greatest drawback was the loss of sunset
effects; we should, theoretically, have had the sunrise instead,
but the mornings were often grey and misty, and it did not clear
till later in the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the charms of the channels, is the smoothness of
the water: we were able to carry our cutter in the davits as
well as the dinghy. It also suited the motor, which proved of the
greatest use, entirely redeeming its character, there is no doubt
however, that to become accustomed to sailing is to be spoilt
for any other method of progression. The photographers accomplished
something, but the scenery scarcely lends itself to the
camera and the light was seldom good. The water-colour scribbles
with which I occupied myself serve their purpose as a personal
diary.</p>

<p class='c007'>We speculated from time to time whether these parts will
ultimately turn into the “playground of South America,” when
that continent becomes densely populated after the manner of
Europe, and amused ourselves by selecting sites for fashionable
hotels: golf-courses no mortal power will ever make. On the
whole the probability seems the other way, for the climate is
against it; it is too near to the Antarctic to be warm even under
the most favourable conditions, and the Andes will always
intercept the rain-clouds of the Pacific. One of the survey-ships
chronicled an average of eleven hours of rain in the twenty-four,
all through the summer months. We ourselves were fortunate
both in the time of year and in the weather. It resembled in our
experience a cold and wet October at home; but there were
few days, I cannot recall more than two, when we lost the greater
part of the view through fog and rain. On the rare occasions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>when it was sunny and clear the effect was disappointing, and
less impressive than when the mountains were seen partially
veiled in mist and with driving cloud. The last hundred miles
before the Gulf of Peñas it became markedly warmer, and the
steam heating was no longer necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was far from our thoughts that exactly one year later these
same channels would witness a game of deadly hide-and-seek
in a great naval war between Germany and England. In them
the German ship <em>Dresden</em> lay hidden, after making her escape
from the battle of the Falkland Islands, while for two and a half
months English ships looked for her in vain. They explored in
the search more than 7,000 miles of waterway, not only taking
the risks of these uncharted passages, but expecting round every
corner to come upon the enemy with all her guns trained on
the spot where they must appear.</p>

<p class='c007'>We left Punta Arenas on Saturday, November 29th, 1913,
spending the night in Freshwater Bay, and the next afternoon
anchored in St. Nicholas Bay, which is on the mainland. Opposite
to it, on the other side of the Straits, is Dawson Island, and
separating Dawson from the next island to the westward is
Magdalen Sound, which leads into Cockburn Channel; it was in
this last that the <em>Dresden</em> found her first hiding-place after
escaping from Sturdee’s squadron and obtaining an illicit supply
of coal at Punta Arenas. St. Nicholas Bay forms the mouth of
a considerable river, the banks of which are clothed with forests
which come down to the sea; near the estuary is a little island,
and on it there is a conspicuous tree. Mr. Corry and I went out
in the boat, and found affixed to the tree a number of boards
with the names of vessels which had visited the place. Jeffery
scrambled up and added <em>Mana’s</em> card to those already there.
This was our first introduction to a plan frequently encountered
later in out-of-the-way holes and corners, and which subsequently
played a part in the war. At the outbreak of hostilities the
<em>Dresden</em> was in the Atlantic, and had to creep round the Horn to
join the squadron of Von Spee in the Pacific. She put into Orange
Bay, one of the furthest anchorages to the south; there she found
that many months before the <em>Bremen</em> had left her name on a
similar board. Moved by habit someone on the cruiser wrote below
it “<em>Dresden</em>, September 11th, 1914”; then caution supervened,
and the record was partially, but only partially, obliterated;
there it was shortly afterwards read by the British ships <em>Glasgow</em>
and <em>Monmouth</em>, and formed a record of the proceedings of the
enemy.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>On Monday, December 1st, we started at daylight and made
our way with motor and sail as far as Cape Froward, the most
southerly point of the Straits; but the sea was running too high
to proceed. We had to retrace our steps, and cast anchor again
in St. Nicholas Bay. This time S. and I were determined to
explore the river, so, after an early luncheon, in order to get
the benefit of the tide, we made our way up it in the cutter.
It was most pleasant rowing between the banks of the quiet
stream, and so warm and sheltered that we might almost have
imagined ourselves on the Cherwell, if the illusion had not been
dispelled by the strange vegetation which overhung the banks,
amongst which were beautiful flowering azaleas. Every here
and there also a bend in the course of the river gave magnificent
views of snow-clad peaks above. A happy little family of teal,
father, mother, and children, disported themselves in the water.
Later in the voyage, as the mountains grew steeper, we had
many waterfalls, but never again a river which was navigable
to any distance. Some of the crew had been left to cut firewood,
and we found on our return that they had achieved a splendid
collection, which Mr. Ritchie and Mr. Corry had kindly been
helping to chop. Burning wood was not popular in the galley,
but we were anxious to save our supplies of coal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tuesday, December 2nd, we again left the bay, and this time
were more fortunate. It was misty and sunless, but as we
rounded Cape Froward it stood out grandly, with its foot in
grey seas and with driving clouds above. We had now definitely
entered on the western half of the Straits and were amongst the
spurs of the Andes. As the day advanced the wind freshened,
the clouds were swept away, and blue sky appeared, while the sea
suddenly became dark blue and covered with a mass of foaming,
tumbling waves; on each coast the white-capped mountains
came out clear and strong. This part of the channel, which is
known as Froward Reach, is a path of water, about five miles
wide, lying between rocky walls; and up this track <em>Mana</em> beat
to windward, rushing along as if she thoroughly enjoyed it.
Every few minutes came the call “Ready about, lee oh!” and
over she went on a fresh tack, travelling perfectly steadily, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>listed over until the water bubbled beneath the bulwarks on the
lee side. It would have been a poor heart indeed that did not
rejoice, and every soul on board responded to the excitement
and thrill of the motion: that experience alone was worth many
hundred miles of travel. As evening came the wind sank, and
we were glad of the prosaic motor to see us into our haven at
Fortescue Bay.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day the wind was too strong to attempt to leave
the harbour, and we went to bed with the gale still raging, but
during the night it disappeared, and before dawn we were under
way. As light and colour gradually stole into the dim landscape,
the grey trunks and brown foliage of trees on the near mountain-sides
gave the effect of the most lovely misty brown velvet.
Rain and mist subsequently obscured the view, but it cleared
happily as we turned into the harbour of Angosto on the southern
side of the channel. Rounding the corner of a narrow entrance,
we found ourselves in a perfect little basin about a quarter of
a mile across, surrounded with steep cliffs some 300 feet in
height, on one side of which a waterfall tore down from the
snows above. Our geologist reported it as a glacier tarn, which,
as the land gradually sank, had been invaded by the sea. We
left it with regret at daylight next morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Straits became now broader and the scenery was more
bleak, the great grey masses being scarcely touched with vegetation
till they reached the water’s edge. It was decided to spend
the night at Port Churruca in Desolation Island, rather than
at Port Tamar on the mainland opposite, which is generally
frequented by vessels on entering and leaving the Straits. We
passed through the entrance into a rocky basin, but when
we were at the narrowest part between precipitous cliffs the
motor stopped. It had been frequently pointed out, when we
were wrestling with the engine, how perilous would be our position
if anything went wrong with it in narrow waters. I confess that
I held my breath. S. disappeared into the engine-room, the Navigator’s
eyes were glued to the compass, and the Sailing-master
gave orders to stand by the boats in case it was necessary to
run out a kedge anchor and attach the yacht to the shore. It
was a distinct relief when the throb of the motor was once more
heard; the difficulty had arisen from the lowness of the temperature,
which had interfered with the flow of the oil. The ship, however, was luckily well under control, with the wind at the moment
behind her. In an inner basin soundings were taken, “twenty-five
fathoms no bottom, thirty fathoms no bottom,” till, when
the bowsprit seemed almost touching the sheer wall of rock, the
Nassau Anchorage was found and down went the hook.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>We grew well acquainted with Churruca, as we were detained
there for five days; Saturday through the overhauling of the
engine; Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday by bad weather; of
Wednesday more anon. The position was not without a certain
eeriness: we lay in this remote niche in the mountains, while the
storm raged in the channel without and in the peaks above; at
night, after turning in, the gale could be heard tearing down from
above in each direction in turn, and the vessel’s chain rattling
over the stony bottom as she swung round to meet it. The
heavy rain turned every cliff-face into a multitude of waterfalls,
which vanished at times into the air as a gust of wind caught
the jet of water and converted it into a cloud of spray. Although
the weather prevented our venturing outside, it was quite possible
to explore the port by means of the ship’s boats. It proved not
unlike Angosto, but on a larger and more complicated scale.
Beyond our inner anchorage, although invisible from it, was a
further extension known as the Lobo Arm, and there were also
other small creeks and inlets.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even the prosaic Sailing Directions venture on the statement
that the scenery at Port Churruca is “scarcely surpassed,”
and one of the fiords must be described, although the attempt
seems almost profane. In its narrow portion it was about
a mile in length and from 100 to 200 yards in width; the
sheer cliffs on either hand were clothed to the height of many
hundreds of feet with various forms of fern and most brilliant
moss. Above this belt of colour was bleak crag, and higher again
the snow-line. The gorge ended in a precipice, above which was
a mountain-peak; a glacier descending from above had been
arrested in its descent by the precipice and now stood above it,
forming part of it, a sheer wall of ice and snow as if cut off by a
giant knife. There was little life to be seen, but an occasional
gleam was caught from the white breast of a sea-bird against the
dark setting of the ravine. In one part, high up on the cliff, where
the wind was deflected by a piece of overhanging rock, was a
little colony of nests; the mother birds and young broods sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>on the edge in perfect shelter, even when to venture off it was
to be beaten down on to the surface of the water by the strength
of the wind. Some of our party visited the fiord on a second
occasion to try to obtain photographs; it was blowing at the
time a severe gale, and the effect was magical. The squalls,
known as “williwaws,” rushed down the ravine in such force
that the powerful little launch was brought to a standstill. They
lashed the water into waves, and then turned the foaming crests
into spray, till the whole surface presented the aspect of a fiercely
boiling cauldron, through which glimpses could be caught from
time to time of the dark cliffs above.</p>

<p class='c007'>While S. and I were visiting the glacier gorge, the two other
members of the party were exploring the last portion of the
inlet named on the chart the Lobo Arm. It terminated on low
ground, on which stood the frame of an Indian hut, and pieces
of timber had been laid down to form a portage for canoes.
A few steps showed that the low ground extended only for
some 160 yards, while beyond this was another piece of water
which had the appearance of an inland lake, some three miles
long and a mile wide. The portage end of the water was vaguely
shown on the chart of Port Churruca, but there was no indication
of anything of the kind on the general map of Desolation
Island. Our curiosity was mildly excited, and we all visited the
place; one of our number remarked that “the water was slightly
salt,” another that there “were tidal indications,” a third that
“from higher ground the valley seemed to go on indefinitely.”
At last the map was again and more seriously examined, and
it was seen that, while there were no signs of this water, there
were on the opposite side of the island the commencements of
two inlets from the open sea, neither of which had been followed
up: the more northerly of these was immediately opposite Port
Churruca. “If,” we all agreed, “our lake is not a lake at all, but
a fiord”—and to this every appearance pointed—“it is in all
probability the termination of this northern inlet, and Desolation
Island is cut in two except for the small isthmus with the portage.”
Then a great ardour of exploration seized us, Mr. Corry fell a
victim to it, Mr. Gillam fell likewise, and we refused to be depressed
by Mr. Ritchie’s dictum that it had “nothing to do with
serious navigation.” We wrestled with a conscientious conviction
that it had certainly nothing to do with Easter Island,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and we ought to go forward at the earliest possible moment, but
the exploration fever conquered. We discussed the possibility
of getting the motor-launch over the portage, and were obliged
reluctantly to abandon it as too heavy, but it was concluded
that it would be quite feasible with the cutter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day proved too wet to attempt anything, but
Wednesday dawned reasonably fine, though with squalls at
intervals. Great were the preparations, from compasses, notebooks,
and log-lines, to tinned beef and dry boots. At last at
11.30 (or 6.30 a.m. by true time) we sallied forth. The launch
towed us down the Lobo Arm, and then came the work of passing
the boat across the isthmus, at which all hands assisted. It was
the prettiest sight imaginable; the portage, which had been cut
through the thick forest undergrowth, had the appearance of a
long and brilliant tunnel between the two waters, it was carpeted
with bright moss and overhung by trees which were covered with
lichen (fig. 14). The bottom was soft and boggy, and I at
one time became so firmly embedded that I could not get out
without assistance. In less than half an hour the boat was
launched on the other side, and Mr. Corry, Mr. Gillam, our two
selves, and two seamen set forth on our voyage. Soon after
starting the creek divided, part going to the north-west and part
to the south-east. We decided to follow the latter as apparently
the main channel.</p>

<p class='c007'>We rowed for an hour and a quarter, taking our rate of
speed by the log. The mountains on each side were of
granite, showing very distinct traces of ice action. At 2 p.m.
we landed on the left bank for luncheon. It was, it must
be admitted, a somewhat wet performance; the soaked wood
proved too much even for our expert campers-out, who
had been confident that they could make a fire under all
circumstances, and had disdainfully declined a proffered
thermos. Enthusiasm was, however, undamped. Mr. Corry
ascended to high ground and discovered that there was another
similar creek on the other side of the strip of ground on which
we had landed, which converged towards that along which we
were travelling. After rowing for an hour and a half we reached
the point where the two creeks joined; here we landed and
scrambled up through some brushwood to the top of a low
eminence. Looking backwards we could see up both pieces of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>water, while looking forward the two fiords, now one, passed
at right angles, after some four miles, into a larger piece of water.
This was where we had expected to find the open sea, and some
distant blue mountains on the far horizon were somewhat of
an enigma. As we had to row back against a head wind, it was
useless to think of going further, unless we were prepared to
camp out, so all we could do was to make as exact sketches as
possible to work out at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>The return journey was easier than had been expected, for the
wind dropped; we kept this time to the right bank, and stopped
for “tea” by some rocks, which added mussels to the repast for
the taking. The portage was gained four hours after the time
that the rest of the crew had been told to meet us there; and it
was a relief to find that they had possessed their souls with
patience. <em>Mana</em> was finally reached at 11 p.m. It was found by
calculating the speed at which we had travelled and its direction,
that our creek had led into the more southerly of the unsurveyed
inlets, and not as we had expected into that to the northward.
The distant blue hills were islands. Like all great explorers, from
Christopher Columbus downwards, our results were therefore not
precisely those we had looked for, but we had undoubtedly proved
our contention that Desolation Island is in two halves, united
only by the 160 yards covered by the portage on the Lobo
Isthmus.</p>

<p class='c007'>A knowledge of the existence of this channel, connecting the
Pacific Ocean with the Magellan Straits, might be of high importance
to the crew of a vessel lost to the south of Cape Pillar,
when making for the entrance to the Straits. Instead of trying
to round that Cape against wind at sea, her boats should run
to the southward until the entrance to the inlet is reached; they
can then enter the Magellan Straits without difficulty at Port
Churruca. With the consent of the Royal Geographical Society,
it has been christened “Mana Inlet.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The next morning, December 1st, we left Churruca with a fair
wind, so that the engine was only needed at the beginning and
end of the day; but the weather was drizzling and unpleasant, so
that we could see little of Cape Pillar,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> where the Magellan Straits
enter the Pacific Ocean. Our own course was up the waterways
between the western coast of Patagonia and the islands
which lie off the coast. It is a route that is little taken, owing
to the dangers of navigation. Not only is much of it uncharted
and unsurveyed, but it is also unlighted, and its passage is
excluded by the ordinary insurance terms of merchant ships;
they consequently pass out at once into the open sea at Cape
Pillar. We turned north at Smyth’s Channel, the first of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>waterways, and made such good progress that, instead of anchoring
as we had intended at Burgoyne’s Bay, we were able to reach
Otter Bay. It is situated amid a mass of islands, and the sad
vision of a ship with her back broken emphasised the need for
caution. The general character of the Patagonian Channels
is of the same nature as the Magellan Straits, but particularly
beautiful views of the Andes are obtained to the eastward. The
next day Mount Burney was an impressive spectacle, although
only glimpses of the top could be obtained through fleeting
mists; and the glistening heights of the Sarmiento Cordillera
came out clear and strong. We anchored that night at Occasion
Cove on Piazzi Island; and on Saturday, December 13th, had a
twelve hours’ run, using the engine all the way. Here there was
a succession of comparatively monotonous hills and mountains,
so absolutely rounded by ice action as to give the impression of
apple dumplings made for giants. The lines show always, as
would be expected, that the ice-flow has been from the south.
Later a ravine on Esperanza Island was particularly remarkable;
its mysterious windings, which it would have been a joy to
explore, were alternately hidden by driving cloud or radiant
with gleams of sun. Glimpses up Peel Inlet gave pleasant
views, and two snowy peaks on Hanover Island, unnamed as
usual, were absorbing our attention when we turned into
Latitude Cove.</p>

<p class='c007'>On December 14th the landscape was absolutely grey and
colourless, so that Guia Narrows were not seen to advantage.
Later the channel was wider and the possibility of sailing debated,
but abandoned in view of the head wind. We had been
struck with the absence of life and fewness of birds, but we
now saw some albatrosses. In slacking away the anchor preparatory
to letting go in Tom Bay, in a depth stated to be
seventeen fathoms, it hit an uncharted rock at eleven fathoms.
It was still raining as we left Tom Bay, but when we turned up
Brassey Pass, which lies off the regular channel, the clouds
began to lift, and Hastings Fiord and Charrua Bay were grand
beyond description. From time to time the mists rose for an
instant, and revealed the immediate presence of reach beyond
reach of wooded precipices; or a dark summit appeared without
warning, towering overhead at so great a height that, severed by
cloud from its base, it seemed scarcely to belong to the earth.
Then as suddenly the whole panorama was cut off, and we were
alone once more with a grey sea and sky.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>As we approached Charrua, we caught sight among the trees
on a neighbouring island of something which was both white
and nebulous; it might, of course, be only an isolated wreath of
mist, but after watching it for a while we came to the conclusion
that it was undoubtedly a cloud of smoke. Our hopes of seeing
Indians, which had grown faint, began to revive. As soon as
we were anchored, orders were given that immediately after
dinner the launch should be ready for us to inspect what we
hoped might prove a camping-ground. This turned out to be
unnecessary, as the neighbours made the first call. In an hour’s
time S. came to inform me that two canoes were approaching
full of natives “just like the picture-books,” whereon the anthropologists
felt inclined to adapt the words of the immortal Snark-hunters
and exclaim:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Seven days to the week I allow,</div>
      <div class='line'>But an Indian on whom we might lovingly gaze</div>
      <div class='line in4'>We have never beheld until now.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The crew, however, were fully convinced that the hour had
arrived when they would have to defend themselves against
ferocious savages. They had been carefully primed in every
detail by disciples of Ananias at Buenos Aires, and by the bloodcurdling
accounts of a certain mariner named Slocum, who claimed
to have sailed the Straits single-handed and to have protected
himself from native onslaught by means of tin-tacks sprinkled
on the deck of his ship. The canoes were about 23 feet in
length, with beam of 4 to 6 feet and a depth of 2 feet. Six
Indians were in one and seven in the other; all were young
with the exception of one older man, and each boat contained a
mother and baby. Their skins were a dark olive, which was
relieved in the case of the women and children by a beautiful
tinge of pink in the cheeks, and they had very good teeth. Their
hair was long and straight, and a fillet was habitually worn
round the brow; the top was cut <i><span lang="fr">à la brosse</span></i>, giving the impression
of a monk’s tonsure which had been allowed to grow. The
height of the men was about 5 feet 4 inches. Most of the party
were clad in old European garments, but a few wore capes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>skins, and some seemed still more at home in a state of nature.
They had brought nothing for sale, but begged for biscuits and
old clothes. I parted with a wrench from a useful piece of calico,
in the interests of one of the infants, which was still in its primitive
condition; it was accepted, but with a howl of derision, which
I humbly felt was well merited when it was seen that the rival
baby was already wrapped in an old waistcoat given by the cook.
One of the Indians talked a little Spanish, and was understood to
say he was a Christian.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dealing with them for a while we offered to tow them
home, an offer readily understood, and accepted without hesitation.
It was a strange procession amid weird surroundings; the
sun had shown signs of coming out, but had thought better of
it and retreated, and we made our way over a grey sea, between
half-obscure cliffs in drizzling rain, taking keen note of our route
for fear of losing our way back. Truly we seemed to have
reached the uttermost ends of the earth. The lead was taken
by that recent product of civilisation a motor-launch, containing
our two selves and our Glasgow socialist engineer; then at the
end of a rope came the dinghy, to be used for landing, the broad
back of one of our Devonshire seamen making a marked object
as he stood up in it to superintend the towing of the craft behind.
The two canoes followed, full of these most primitive specimens
of humanity, while the rear was brought up by a seal, which swam
after us for a mile or so, putting up its head at intervals to gaze
curiously at the scene. S. had brought his gun, and as we
approached the camp thought it well to shoot a sea-bird, for the
double reason of showing that he was armed and giving a present
to our new friends. The encampment was situated in a little
cove, and nothing could have been more picturesque. In front
was a shingly beach, on which the two canoes were presently
drawn up, flanked by low rocks covered with bright seaweed.
In the background was a mass of trees, shrubs, and creepers, which
almost concealed two wigwams, from one of which had issued the
smoke which attracted our notice (fig. 16).</p>

<p class='c007'>We returned next morning to photograph and study the
scene. The size of the shelters, or tents, was about 12 feet by
9 feet, with a height of some 5 feet. They were formed by a
framework of rods set up in oval form, the tops of which were
brought together and interwoven, and strengthened by rods laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>horizontally and tied in place: the opening was at the side and
towards the sea. Over this structure seals’ skins were thrown,
which kept in place by their own weight, as the encampments
are always made in sheltered positions in dense forests. With
the exception that they do not possess a ridge-pole, the tents,
which are always the same in size and make, closely resemble
those of English gipsies, the skins taking the place of the blankets
used by those people. No attempt was made to level the floor,
the fire was in the middle, and in one the sole occupant was a
naked sprawling baby, who occupied the place of honour on the
floor beside it. In some of the old encampments, which we saw
subsequently, there were as many as six huts, but it was doubtful
if they had all been occupied at the same time. The middens
are outside and generally near the door. Some of the Indians
were quite friendly, but others were not very cordial, the old
women in particular making it clear to the men of the party
that their presence was not welcome. The old man, whose picture
appears (fig. 17), was apparently the patriarch of the party, and
quite amiable, though he firmly declined to part with his symbol
of authority in the shape of his club; in order to keep him quiet
while his photograph was taken he was fed on biscuits, which
he was taught to catch after the manner of a pet dog. The staff
of life is mussels and limpets, and we saw in addition small
quantities of berries. A lump of seal fat weighing perhaps
10 lb. was being gnawed like an apple, and a portion was offered
to our party. The dogs are smooth-haired black-and-tan terriers,
like small heavy lurchers; they are, it is said, taught to assist their
masters in the catching of fish.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The company presently showed signs of unusual activity, and
began to shift camp; the movement was not connected, as far
as we could tell, with our presence, and, judging by the odour
of the place, the time for it had certainly arrived. It was interesting
to see their chattels brought down one by one to the
canoes. Amongst them were receptacles resembling large pillboxes,
about 12 inches across, made of birchwood, which was
split thin and sewn with tendons. In these were kept running
nooses made of whalebone for capturing wild geese, and also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>harpoon-lines cut out of sealskin: at one extremity of these last
was a barbed head made of bone; this head, when in use, fits into
the extremity of a long wooden shaft, to which it is then attached
by the leather thong. The possessions included an adze-like
tool for making canoes, the use of which was demonstrated, and
resembled that of a plane; also an awl about 2 inches long, in
form like a dumb-bell, with a protruding spike at one end. There
were small pots made of birch bark for baling the boats, and some
European axes. We did not see any form of cooking utensil.
When all the objects, including the sealskin coverings of the huts,
had been stowed in the canoes, the company all embarked and
rowed off towards the open sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>On leaving Charrua and returning to the main channel we
obtained magnificent views of the Andes. Penguin Inlet leading
inland opened up a marvellous panorama of snowy peaks, which
can be visible only on a clear day such as we were fortunate
in possessing; this range received at least one vote, in the final
comparing of notes, as to the most beautiful thing seen between
Punta Arenas and the Gulf of Peñas. A white line across the
water showed where the ice terminated, while small pieces which
reached the main channel, looked, as they floated past us, like
stray waterlilies on the surface of the sea. We anchored at
Ring Dove Inlet, and went on next day through Chasm Reach,
where the channel is only from five hundred to a thousand
yards in width. Our expectations, which had been greatly
raised, were on the whole disappointed, but here again no
doubt it was a question of lighting; the usually gloomy gorge
was illuminated with the full radiance of the summer sun, leaving
nothing to the imagination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chasm Reach leads into Indian Reach, in which sea, mountain,
and sky formed a perfect harmony in varying shades of blue,
with touches of white from high snow-clad peaks. Suddenly,
in the middle of this vista, as if made to fit into the scene, appeared
a dark Indian canoe with its living freight, evidently
making for the vessel. We stopped the engine, threw them a
line, and towed them to our anchorage in Eden Harbour. The
weather had suddenly become much warmer, and the thermometer
in the saloon had now risen to the comfortable but scarcely excessive
height of 64°; the crew of the canoe, however, were so
overcome with the heat that they spent the time pouring
what must have been very chilly sea water over their naked
bodies.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The party was conducted by two young men; a very old woman
without a stitch of clothing crouched in the bow; while in the
middle of the boat, in the midst of ashes, mussel-shells, and
other débris, a charming girl mother sat in graceful attitude.
She was, perhaps, seventeen, and wore an old coat draped round
her waist, while her baby, of some eighteen months, in the attire
of nature, occupied itself from time to time in trying to stand
on its ten toes. A younger girl of about fourteen sat demurely
in the stern with her folded arms resting on a paddle which lay
athwart the canoe, beneath which two shapely little brown legs
were just visible. Her rich colouring, and the faded green
drapery which she wore, made against the dark background of
the canoe a perfect study for an artist, but the moment an
attempt was made to photograph her she hid her face in her
hands. The party was completed by a couple of dogs and a
family of fat tan puppies, who were held up from time to time,
but whether for our admiration or purchase was not evident.</p>

<p class='c007'>The belongings were similar to those seen at the encampment
and there were also baskets on board. The young mother had
a necklace which looked like a charm, and therefore particularly
excited our desires: in response to our gestures she handed to
us a similar one worn by the baby, which was duly paid for in
matches. When we were still unsatisfied she beckoned to the
young girl to sell hers, but stuck steadfastly to her own, till
finally a mixed bribe of matches and biscuits proved too much,
and the cherished ornament passed into our keeping. The young
men readily came on deck of the yacht, but the women were
obviously frightened, and kept saying <em>mala, mala</em> in spite of our
efforts to reassure them. After we had cast anchor, the party
went with our crew to show them the best spot in which to
shoot the net, and on their return ran up the square sail of their
canoe, the halyard passing over a mast like a small clothes-prop
with a <span class='large'><strong><span class='sans'>Y</span></strong></span>-shaped extremity, got out their paddles, and vanished
down-stream.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>At Eden Harbour a wreck was lying in mid-stream, where
she had evidently struck on an uncharted rock when trying
to enter the bay, a danger from which no possible foresight
can guard those who go down to the sea in ships. English
Narrows, which was next reached, is considered the most difficult
piece of navigation in the channels: a small island lies in the
middle of the fairway, leaving only a narrow passage on either
side, down which, under certain conditions, the tide runs at a
terrific rate. It was exciting, as the yacht approached her course
between the island and opposing cliff which are separated by
only some 360 yards, to hear Mr. Ritchie ask Mr. Gillam to take
the helm himself, and the latter give the order to “stand by
the anchor” in case of mishap; but we had hit it off correctly
at slack water and got through without difficulty. From there
our route passed through Messier Channel, which has all the
appearance of a broad processional avenue, out of which we
presently turned to the right and found ourselves in Connor
Cove. The harbour terminates in a precipitous gorge, down
which a little river makes its way into the inlet. We endeavoured
to row up it, but could not get further than 100 or 200
yards; even that distance was achieved with difficulty, owing to
the number of fallen trees which lay picturesquely across the
stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plant life, which had always been most beautiful, became
even more glorious with the rather milder climate, which we
had now reached. When the trees were stunted it was from
lack of soil, not from atmospheric conditions. Tree-ferns
abounded, and flowering plants wandered up moss-grown stems;
among the most beautiful of these blooms were one with a red
bell and another one which almost resembled a snowdrop.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The
impression of the luxuriant <i><span lang="fr">mêlé</span></i> was rather that of a tropical
forest than of an almost Antarctic world, while the intrusion of
rocks and falling water added peculiar charm. Butterflies were
seen occasionally, and sometimes humming-birds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since our detention at Churruca we had been favoured with
unvarying good fortune, and the crew were beginning to say
that thirteen, which we had counted on board since Mr. Corry
joined us, was proving our lucky number. Now, however, our
fate changed; twice did we set forth from this harbour only to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>obliged to return and start afresh, till we began to feel that
getting under way from Connor Cove was rapidly becoming a
habit. On the first occasion the weather became so thick that
in the opinion of our Navigator it was not safe to proceed: the
second time the wind was against us. We tried both engine and
sails, but though we could make a certain amount of headway
under either it was obviously impossible, at the rate of progression,
to reach the next haven before nightfall; when, therefore,
we were already half-way to our goal we once more found
it necessary to turn round. It was peculiarly tantalising to
reflect that there were, in all probability, numerous little creeks
on the way in which we could have sheltered for the night, but
as none of them had been surveyed there was no alternative but
to go back to our previous anchorage. Residence there had
the redeeming point that it proved an excellent fishing-ground.
On each of the three nights the trammel was shot at a short
distance from the spot where the stream entered the bay,
and we obtained in all some 200 mullet. They formed an
acceptable change of diet, and those not immediately needed
were salted. From that time till we left the channels we were
never without fresh fish, catching, in addition to mullet, bream,
gurnet, and a kind of whiting; they formed part of the menu
at every meal, till the more ribald persons suggested that they
themselves would shortly begin to swim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our third effort to leave Connor Cove was crowned with
greater success, and we safely reached Island Harbour, which,
as its name suggests, is sheltered by outlying islands. This
bay and the neighbouring anchorage of Hale Cove are the
last two havens in the channels before the Gulf of Peñas is
reached, and in either of them a vessel can lie with comfort
and await suitable weather for putting out to sea. It is
essential for a sailing vessel to obtain a fair wind, for not
only has she to clear the gulf, but must, for the sake of safety,
put 200 miles between herself and the land; otherwise, should
a westerly gale arise, she might be driven back on to the inhospitable
Patagonian coast. In Island Harbour we filled our
tanks, adorned the ship for’ard with drying clothes and fish, and
for three days waited in readiness to set forth. At the end of
that time it was still impossible to leave the channels, but we
decided to move on the short distance to Hale Cove, which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>reached on December 24th. Christmas Eve was spent by three
of our party, Mr. Ritchie, Mr. Corry, and Mr. Gillam, on a small
rock “taking stars” till 2 a.m. The rock, which had been
selected at low tide, grew by degrees unexpectedly small, and
to keep carefully balanced on a diminishing platform out of
reach of the rising water, while at the same time being continuously
bitten by insects, was, they ruefully felt, to make
scientific observations under difficulties. On Christmas Day
it poured without intermission, but it was a peaceful if not an
exciting day. It is, I believe, the correct thing to give the
menu on these occasions: the following was ours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The forecastle was visited after dinner and each man given a
half-pound tin of tobacco. Boxing Day was comparatively
fine, and a laundry was organised on shore with great success; a
fire was made, old kerosene tins turned into boilers, and the
articles washed in camp-baths with water from a streamlet. It
is one thing, however, to wet clothes in the Patagonian Channels;
it is quite another to dry them. For days afterwards the rain
descended in torrents, while the wind blew persistently from the
north-west; with one short intermission we lay in Hale Cove
weather-bound for thirteen days, till, as some one remarked, “it
was a pity that we had not given it as a postal address.” It
was tiresome of course, but an interval of rest for all on board
after the strenuous passage of the channels was not without
advantage; for ourselves journals were written up, flowers pressed,
and photographs developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hale Cove was fortunately one of those few ports in which
it was possible to get a little exercise, which the denseness of
the undergrowth generally rendered impossible. The cliffs, at
the foot of which <em>Mana</em> lay, were precipitous and clothed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>vegetation to the sky-line, they thus scarcely lent themselves
to exploration. There was, however, across the small bay a
southern spur, on the top of which for some reason trees had
not flourished and which was comparatively clear; this it was
possible to reach by landing on a little beach and scrambling
along an old track which had been cut through an intermediate
belt of wood. We could in this way get some sort of a walk,
at the cost of course of becoming soaked through from bogs and
dripping vegetation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not far from the cove there were traces of a small frame house,
and near it flourished European wheat and grass, which had obviously
taken root from stray seed. Its history was difficult to
guess. Why had a white man lived there, and on what had he
subsisted? The only solution suggested was that it might at
one time have been a port of call for a line of steamers, and a
woodman had been employed to cut fuel. Another dwelling, but
made of material found on the spot, had obviously been destroyed
by fire, and on its abandoned site native wigwams had
been erected. The place was evidently the resort of Indians;
when, therefore, we noted near the old track, and not far from
the water-course, part of two rough boards protruding from the
earth, we hoped that we had chanced on an Indian burial-ground,
which would naturally have been of much anthropological interest.
The soil which had originally covered the boards had
been partially washed away by the rain, and on moving them we
found, as had been guessed, that just below were human bones;
they were so deeply encrusted with roots and earth that it was
only by much digging with our fingers we could get them out at
all. Then they proved to be in much confusion, two parts of the
skull even were in different places, and it was difficult at first
to say whether the body, which was that of a man in middle life,
had been buried full length or in the folded attitude so common
among primitive peoples. It was my first experience in scientific
body-snatching, a proceeding to which later I became fairly
well inured, and it felt not a little weird being thus in contact
with the dead in his lonely resting-place. A great tree-fern kept
guard over the grave on one side, a gnarled trunk bent over it
from the other, and the sun gleamed at intervals through the
thick branches of surrounding cedars. At last it became obvious
that the body had been outstretched, and the grave lined as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>as covered with boards, in addition to which there had been a
wrapping of some woven material; it seemed therefore evident
that the corpse had been that of a civilised man. Who was he?
the lumberman, the remains of whose hut we had seen? one of
the crew of some vessel which had put in here? or possibly a
shipwrecked mariner? for there were traces of an ill-fated vessel
in a quantity of coal washed up on the beach. Why, though
he had been buried with considerable care, was the grave so
shallow, and why had it been left unmarked? We buried him
again reverently, and though he was very possibly an unpleasant
person when alive, the thoughts of one of us at least, who is
naturally mid-Victorian, turned to the mother who had once
borne and tended him somewhere and who could so little have
pictured where he would lie.</p>

<p class='c015'>We discussed marking the spot, but came to the conclusion that
the best way to prevent its again being disturbed was to obliterate
all traces of it; so there the nameless man rests on in his hidden
grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wind still being contrary, charts and sailing directions
were ransacked for change of scene, and on New Year’s Eve
we shifted our quarters, proceeding up Krüger Channel, and
anchoring in a little cove called after De Wet: as Joubert was
also in the neighbourhood, officials of the Chilean Government
who had surveyed the district had apparently been of pro-Boer
sympathies. On January 1st, 1914, we went out into the Gulf of
Peñas, only to find that it was useless to attempt to put to sea,
and we returned again to Hale Cove. The <em>Challenger</em> had, we
found, anchored in the same spot on New Year’s Day, 1876.
During the next few days Mr. Ritchie, with the help of Mr. Corry,
occupied himself at my husband’s request in surveying a small
cove as a possible anchorage for lesser craft.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>A shooting expedition also took place after kelp-geese, which
are large birds about the size of Aylesbury ducks. When
cruising in the launch we saw at some distance a couple
of them swimming in the sea; we circled round them in the
endeavour to get a shot, till we were about a hundred yards
distant, when they took the alarm and made off. They are
unable to fly, but when, as in this case, they anticipate danger
scuttle along on the top of the water, lashing it up with their
webbed feet. The surface was smooth as a mirror, and the boat
went about seven miles an hour, but for some two miles we
were unable to overhaul them. Presently they dived and
separated, and on their reappearance we continued to follow
one of them. During the whole of the pursuit, whenever the
wobbling of the boat and the antics of the bird permitted the
fore and back sights to be brought in line, a ·275 mauser bullet
was sent somewhere in the neighbourhood of the fleeing object.
The goose apparently came to the conclusion that the white
launch, with its spluttering motor, was a peculiarly formidable
sea-beast, and the safest place would be on land; he therefore
went on shore, climbed up some rocks, and looked at it; a bullet
between his feet, however, unsettled his mind on the subject, and
he once more took to the water, where he finally met his doom.
Light, who happened to be with us, witnessed the chase with
intense delight, and constantly referred to it afterwards as the
most exciting recollection of the voyage. As was not astonishing
in the case of such an athletic bird, no part of him proved to be
eatable except his liver, which was excellent.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, January 6th, we at last got our favourable wind
and said good-bye to Hale Cove. It is the usual resort for
vessels entering and leaving the channels, but we had lain there
for nearly a fortnight in the height of the season without seeing
a trace of a ship, a fact which shows how little these waterways
are frequented. As we passed out of the Gulf of Peñas we gazed
with interest on the unfriendly and barren peaks of Wager Island,
where Anson’s store-ship of that name was lost on May 14th, 1740,
after the squadron had rounded the Horn. The members of the
crew who survived the wreck, one hundred and forty-five in
number, were there for five months, at the end of which time they
had been reduced by about one-third, chiefly through starvation.
Seventy or eighty of the remainder then took to the longboat
and cutter, of whom thirty finally reached the coast of Brazil via
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the Magellan Straits. The rest of the survivors, a party of twenty,
including the captain and an officer named Byron, a great-uncle
of the poet, made their way northward, and through the aid of
Indians four of them managed to reach the Spanish settlements
in Chile. The graphic account given by Byron of their surroundings
on the island would be equally applicable to-day, and
has already been quoted in these pages.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The principal Spanish colonies in South America were, as has been
seen, on the western side of the continent. Balbao crossed the
isthmus of Panama in 1513. In 1531 Pizarro landed in Peru, where
he encountered and overthrew the empire of the Incas. Valdivia,
one of his ablest lieutenants, made his way still further south, and
in 1541 founded Santiago, the present capital of Chile, on the fruitful
plain between the Andes and the sea. His further progress was
checked by the Araucanians, a warlike tribe of Indians, who offered
a much stronger resistance than the Incas. They were never
entirely conquered, and the Spaniards in Chile were engaged in
perpetual struggle with them, while at the same time open to attacks
on the coast from European powers who were at enmity with Spain.
When the revolutionary waves swept the continent the Chilean
patriots were at first compelled to withdraw across the Andes. The
most famous of them was Bernardo O’Higgins; his father, originally
a barefooted Irish boy, was one of the last viceroys of Peru, and
the son became one of the first presidents of the new republic.
Argentina had at this time accomplished her own freedom, and was
able to send help to Chile. General San Martin crossed the Andes,
and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Spaniards at Maipu in 1818.
The revolutionary army then passed north, the Viceroy evacuated
Lima, and at Guayaquil San Martin met the liberator Bolivar, who
had marched down from the north. Meanwhile Admiral Cochrane,
who had reorganised the Chilean and Peruvian navies, had been
engaged in freeing the Pacific from Spanish ships. South America
thus was finally cleared from the domination of the Spaniard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Disputes, however, arose between the new republics as to their
respective boundaries: Chile fought Peru in 1879 over the possession
of the nitrate-fields, and issued victorious from the struggle. The
long series of difficulties between Chile and Argentina was ended,
as has been recorded, through British arbitration, in 1902.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hard not to believe that the “roaring forties” have a
personality: a polytheist who goes thither in ships ought to
sacrifice to the spirit of that unquiet belt. As soon as we had
passed the magic limit of degrees the weather changed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>became beautifully balmy, and the rest of our passage was excellent.
When we again came in sight of land it was in strong
contrast to that which we had left, being brown, dried up, and
somewhat low: all visions of snow-clad Andes had disappeared;
neither here nor at Talcahuano was anything to be seen that
could justify the name of a coast range. Talcahuano, the Chilean
naval port, stands on a magnificently sheltered bay and was
an ideal spot for our purpose of refitting. It is much to
be preferred, from the shipping point of view, to the bay
of Valparaiso, some 260 miles further up the coast, which lies
exposed to the northerly winds and is crowded with shipping.
Through the kindness of Mr. Edwards, the Chilean minister in
London, a naval order had been promulgated some time before
our arrival giving instructions that the Expedition was to be
afforded all facilities. We accordingly met with every courtesy,
and the yacht was almost at once placed in the floating dock to
allow of the examination of her bottom, an essential proceeding,
as it had not been overlooked, except by a diver at Punta Arenas,
since we left England, now nearly twelve months ago. A floating
dock consists of a huge tray, with an enormous tank on either
side; when these tanks are filled with water the dock sinks,
and the vessel floats on to the tray, being supported against its
sides, the tanks are then emptied, and the tray rises, bearing the
vessel clear out of the water; when the work is completed the
process is reversed and the ship floats out once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this overhauling, which took four days, came the work
of examining and restowing the hold; this was expedited by
all the contents being taken out and placed in a lighter alongside.
It was the work of the Stewardess to check the stores in
hand, and also those contained in ninety-five new packages from
England which we found awaiting our arrival. On the representation
of our Legation at Santiago, the Government had done
us the favour to remit all duties on them except 5 per cent.,
which it would have required a special Act of Parliament to
repeal. As some goods pay as much as 55 per cent. in customs we
were greatly the gainers, in spite of the fact that an illicit levy
had been taken of our butter and jam, which are among the
most heavily taxed articles, to an amount equivalent to a supply
of some weeks for the saloon party. We were happily able to
make good the deficiency, which would otherwise have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>somewhat maddening, by purchases of honey, which all down this
part of the coast is good and cheap. Jam is ruinously expensive,
if procurable at all, and our sympathy was extended to the
skipper of an English merchant ship in the bay, whose stock was
finished, but whose crew were in no way inclined to waive their
Board of Trade rights, for Jack thinks potted strawberries and
damsons quite as essential an article of diet as does Tommy.
Our loss was less annoying, if also less amusing, than that of the
owners of a lighter which was lying just outside the custom-house,
and which was forcibly despoiled during the night. The thieves
turned out to be the guards set by the custom-house, who apparently
thinking the hours of darkness long had contrived thus
to pass the time. We told this story to one of the inhabitants of
another South American port. “Ah, yes,” he said drily, “the
custom-house here has now a bright electric light; it makes it
easier for them to take out the nails without hurting their
fingers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We were now nearing the end of our outward voyage, and
the provisions had to be divided between the respective sea
and land parties. Easter Island affords no good anchorage,
and our plan was that the yacht, after disembarking the
scientific members and waiting awhile off the coast, should
return to Talcahuano under charge of Mr. Gillam, to collect
letters and goods and then come out again to the island. The
stores, therefore, had to be divided into four lots, with much
arithmetical calculation: firstly, the portion needed by the whole
Expedition for the voyage out, which was expected to last about
a month; secondly, that for the shore party for a period of six
months; thirdly, a share for the crew alone for four months;
and, fourthly, the remainder which was to be left at Talcahuano
and gathered up later. The island allotment was the most
difficult, as we had only a general idea of what it would be possible
to procure on shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was altogether, as will be seen, a considerable work, and
we were hard at it for a fortnight, during which time, with the
exception of two shopping expeditions to the neighbouring city
of Concepcion, we had little opportunity to see the surrounding
country. It felt at any rate dry and warm, in fact well aired,
after the damp of the Patagonian Channels, and might have been
even adjudged too dry and dusty. The most refreshing sight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>was a little garden which adjoined the custom-house steps, at
which we landed almost daily, and which, in spite of difficulties,
was invariably bright with geraniums and other flowers: Chile is
much more a country of gardens, in the English sense, than any
other land it has been my lot to visit. Talcahuano has about
13,000 inhabitants, and consists of little beside the dockyard,
in which the chief posts are filled by Englishmen. Three English
officers are also lent in peace time by our own navy to that of
Chile; one of these, with whom we happened to have mutual
acquaintances, was kind enough to entertain us on board the
Chilean warship, whose name, being translated, was <em>Commodore
Pratt</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A point anxiously debated at the moment, and not without
some practical interest for us, was whether Chile could afford
to keep the Dreadnoughts which were being built for her by
Messrs. Armstrong. There was a financial crisis at the time, and
the exchange was much against Chile; hence firms there which
owed money to England were delaying meeting their liabilities,
with the result that more than one English company had failed
in consequence. The sale of a Dreadnought would of course
greatly affect the rate; even without that before we left the
country it had materially risen, and the value received for a
sovereign was, from our point of view, regrettably diminished.</p>

<p class='c007'>An Englishman feels distinctly more at home in Chile than
in either Brazil or Argentina. Some of the best-known firms are
genuinely English, though the possession of an English name
is in itself no guarantee of more than a remote British origin:
a Mr. Brown may, for instance, marry a Miss Thompson, and
neither be able to speak the English tongue.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Our language
is the only one taught free in the schools; it is presumably the
most useful from the point of view of trade with ourselves and
the United States. One of our countrymen resident in the
Republic explained to us that “the Chileans hate all foreigners,
but they hate the British rather less than the others.” Those
at least were our recorded impressions at this time; on the subsequent
visit of the yacht, after war broke out, the German influence
was strong enough to affect her position adversely in the
way of work and stores.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>At last the provision lists were finished and we felt entitled
to take a holiday, leaving the remainder of the work on the ship
in the competent hands of Mr. Gillam; our special objects were
to see the Easter Island collection in the museum at Santiago
and get a glimpse of the Trans-Andine Railway. This part of
our journeyings has nothing to do with the voyage of the <em>Mana</em>,
and accounts of the ground covered have been given by much
abler hands, notably by Lord Bryce in his <cite>Impressions of South
America</cite>; it shall therefore be told in outline only. We left
Talcahuano by the tri-weekly day express for Santiago; it took
twelve hours to travel about 350 miles, but the Pullman car
was luxurious, and we were able to see the country well. The
line passes northward through the long fruitful plain between
the Andes and the coast range, which constitutes the land
of Chile, and crosses continually the streams which traverse
it on their course from the mountains to the sea. The train
stops from time to time at cheerful little towns, and finally at
Santiago, which is a most attractive city, with a sense of quiet
and yet cheerful dignity. There are but few streets at the end
of which it is not possible to obtain a glimpse of the surrounding
mountains, but they were scarcely either as near or impressive
as descriptions had led us to expect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first night of our residence in the capital we experienced
an earthquake. I was already asleep when about 10.30 I was
awakened by the shock; the light when turned on showed the
chandeliers and pictures swinging in opposite directions, and one
of the latter was still oscillating when the current was switched
off eight or ten minutes later. There was a slighter recurrence
at 3 a.m. The shock was stated to be the worst since the great
earthquake of 1906, and numbers of people had, we found, rushed
out into the streets and squares. It was generally agreed that
familiarity in the case of earthquakes breeds not contempt but
the reverse, and that shocks of which the new-comer thinks but
little, fill those who know their possibilities with nervous alarm.
In this case no great damage was done; the only fatalities occurred
at Talca, a little place about half-way along the line by
which we had come. When we called at the Legation the next
day to express our thanks to the British Minister for the trouble
taken about our stores, we were shown the cracks in the walls
which were the result of the previous earthquake and the fresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>additions made to them the night before. We had the good
fortune at Santiago to become acquainted with Sir Edward and
Lady Grogan. Sir Edward filled the post of military attaché for
six of our South American legations, and I had heard at Buenos
Aires much of the work and interests of Lady Grogan. She was
the almost last Englishwoman whom I met till my return to
my native land two years later, when I had the pleasure of
renewing the acquaintance, this time in Cromwell Road in
proximity to numerous bales for Serbian refugees. We visited
the Museum of Antiquities, where we found the objects from
Easter Island of which we were in search; and the beautiful
new Museum of Fine Arts, which also contains articles from the
island.</p>

<p class='c007'>We left Santiago at noon on Saturday, January 31st, the
line at first continuing northwards. The country through which
we passed looked rainless and barren, and the journey was hot
and tiring. The train was crowded with Saturday travellers,
and purveyors of drinks and ices continually pushed their way
down it, apparently finding a ready market for their wares. At
the junction of Llay-Llay, the line which comes from Santiago on
the south connects with that from Valparaiso on the west, and
branches off also eastward over the Andes to the Argentine.
Here on the platform sat rows of women with some of the delightful
fruit in which Chile abounds: grapes can be bought at
5<em>d.</em> a pound and peaches and nectarines at 8<em>d.</em> or 9<em>d.</em> a dozen.
The drawback, however, in the case of the two last mentioned,
is that, partly owing to the exigencies of packing, the Chileans
make a point of gathering and also eating them quite hard and
flavourless. The conscientious British matron can scarcely see
without distress children of the more prosperous classes, as young
as five or six years, concluding a heavy evening meal at eight
or half-past, by eating entirely unripe peaches. She ceases to
wonder that infant mortality in Chile is said to be heavy.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Llay-Llay we took the easterly line, which ascends a valley
full of prosperous cultivation, till it reaches the little town of
Los Andes, where the Chilean state railway ends and the Trans-Andine
service begins. The two ends of this railway, the Chilean
and Argentine, are in the hands of different companies, which
naturally adds much to the difficulty of working the line. The
trains run on alternate days in each direction. There is a comfortable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>hotel at Los Andes where passengers sleep the previous
night in order to start the journey over the pass at 7 a.m.; much
of the revenue of the line, however, is derived, not from the
passenger traffic, but from the cattle brought from the ranches
of the Argentine to Chile. The Chilean company is an English
one, and the manager, Mr. J. H. White, was good enough to
arrange for us to travel with the French minister, who happened
to be quitting Santiago, in an observation car at the end of the
train; we had, therefore, both pleasant company and most
excellent views of the pass. The line winds up a valley, which
grows ever narrower between precipitous mountain-sides, but as
long as any green thing can find a footing the cultivation is
intense; where the incline is most steep a cog-wheel is employed.
Presently every trace of vegetation is left behind, and the route
enters on its grandest and wildest phase. Bleak rock masses
tower to the sky on every hand, and on their lower slopes rest
masses of boulders, which have descended at some earlier stage
in the world’s history. When a great height has been attained
a little lake is reached, which, with its colouring of gorgeous
blue, resembles a perfect turquoise in a grey setting. At 10,000
feet the highest point is gained and the train enters the tunnel,
which has been bored through the summit and which was opened
for traffic in 1909. It here leaves Chile and issues on the Argentine
side amidst similar but less striking scenery. The line
now runs beneath a series of shelters for protection from snow;
they are of corrugated iron and provided with huge doors which
can be closed in case of drift. The difficulties which arise in
winter from such causes are very great, but at the time of our
visit the snow was as a rule confined to occasional white patches
near the summit of the mountains: the great peak of Aconcagua,
23,000 feet high, which was now to be seen seventeen miles to
the northward, was principally remarkable for standing out
as a huge white mass among its greyer fellows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inca Bridge is shortly reached, and here we left the train.
It is somewhat astonishing to find a large and fashionable hotel
in these surroundings; it is resorted to by the inhabitants of
Buenos Aires when in search of cooler air or desirous of partaking
of the iron waters for which the place is famous. We started at
8 o’clock next morning for the return journey, which we made
by riding with mules over the part of the summit traversed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the tunnel, catching the train on the Chilean side. It is a delightful
and easy expedition, which can be thoroughly recommended.
The road runs at first parallel to the line, and when it
leaves the valley rises by gradual zigzags: our guide dispensed
with all corners by means of short cuts, but even so the ascent
was not strenuous. As we mounted higher and higher the
corrugated iron railway shelters looked like long, headless, grey
caterpillars crawling along the valley beneath. We had been
warned to expect high wind, but it only became unpleasant as
we reached the actual summit, along which runs the boundary
between Chile and Argentina. The celebrated statue of the Christ
with uplifted hands blessing both countries, which commemorates
the arbitration treaty, stands on the main road a little to the
east of the track by which we crossed, which was, as usual, a
short cut.</p>

<p class='c007'>The descent fully justified the impression which we had
formed from the train of the superior grandeur of the Chilean
side; it must be even more impressive when more snow is
visible. We regained the railway in plenty of time to see the
Argentine train issue from the tunnel at 2 o’clock: the travellers
had left Buenos Aires on the morning of the previous day,
traversed the great Argentine plains, and spent the night <i><span lang="fr">en
route</span></i>. If the train is delayed and arrives at the summit too late
to be conveyed down before dark, the Chilean officials refuse
to take it over, as the descent would be too dangerous; the
passengers under such circumstances have to spend the night
in their carriages or find such hotel accommodation as is possible.
They were indeed, as we saw then, a cosmopolitan crowd; the
languages of France, Germany and Spain, also English, of both the
European and American variety, were all being spoken in the
crowded carriage in which we found places. Our nearest neighbours
were two young couples from the United States, evidently
making the journey for the first time; as we began the descent
through the very finest part of the scenery, they produced
packs of cards and became engrossed in a game of auction bridge.
This is one of the things which must be seen to be believed, but
we were subsequently told it was by no means a unique instance.
We arrived at Los Andes, hot and dusty after our early start
and long day, to find ourselves carried off to the manager’s
house and most kindly welcomed by Mrs. and Miss White to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>refreshing tea amid the delight of a cool veranda and beautiful
garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next day we left for Valparaiso, retracing our steps as far
as the junction of Llay-Llay, and then traversing the coast range.
The huge bay of Valparaiso, filled with shipping, is an imposing
sight, and the town climbs picturesquely up the mountains which
surround it; the higher parts are residential, and are reached
by elevators, which are stationed at intervals in the main street,
which runs parallel to the harbour. On the lower level there
are well-built offices of leading firms, shipping lines, and banks,
which give a pleasant sensation of wide interest and touch
with the great world. Nevertheless, Valparaiso is scarcely
as fine a city architecturally as would be expected from its
importance, nor is the hotel accommodation worthy of a first-class
port. Its inhabitants cheerily endorse the opinion of a
visitor who is reported to have said, “There is one word only
for Valparaiso, and that is ‘shabby.’” The city has, however,
profited through the rebuilding necessitated by the earthquake,
and the improvement of the harbour and other works were in
progress. The earthquake is still a very present memory; one
resident showed us the spot where one of his servants, escaping
from the house at the same time as himself, was killed by falling
masonry.</p>

<p class='c007'>We called on Messrs. Williamson &#38; Balfour; the firm have a
financial interest in Easter Island, and it was through their kind
permission that we were visiting it. We saw Mr. Hope-Simpson,
one of the managing partners; his power and expedition filled
us with grateful awe. He sat at the end of a telephone and
appeared to put through in a few minutes all our arrangements,
whether with the Government, shipping, or docks, which would
have taken us many days of weary trudging about the city to
accomplish. I have often thought of that morning when confronted
with the appalling delays in public offices at home.
We were introduced by him to Señor Merlet, the chairman of the
company for the Exploitation of Easter Island, who are the direct
lessees; he had been there himself and was kind enough to give
us all information in his power.</p>

<p class='c007'>We returned to Talcahuano by sea as the easiest method.
There were a few more days of preparation, and on Friday,
February 13th, a date subsequently noted by the superstitious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>we were at length ready to depart. As the last things were
hurried on board it recalled our departure from Falmouth: this
time the deck had to accommodate paraffin tins full of cement
to make a dock for Mr. Ritchie’s tidal observations; the passage
had to find room for a table for survey purposes; rolls of wire
for excavation sieves were strapped beneath beams of the saloon;
while on the top of one was fastened a row of portentous jars,
the object of which was to hold the acid from the batteries when
we left the ship, as the electrical gear would be dismantled when
the engineer came on shore in his capacity of photographer.
Two zinc baths for laundry work in camp were looked at ruefully;
there seemed to be no place for them in heaven or earth, certainly
not on <em>Mana</em>. But half our heavy task of stowage was accomplished
when we were out of Talcahuano Harbour, the boat
began to roll prodigiously, and the work was finished somehow
with astonishing rapidity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day found us all confined to our cabins, having,
after our time on land, temporarily lost our sea legs. By Sunday
we began to feel better, except Mr. Corry, who had a slight temperature
and complained of feeling unwell. When on Monday we
arrived at Juan Fernandez, S. was down with dysentery and a
temperature of 103°, while Mr. Corry’s rose, to our alarm, to
104°; Tuesday and Wednesday he was still in high fever, and
by Wednesday evening it was obviously useless to hope that
his illness was either influenza or malaria: there was nothing
to be done but to act on the third possibility and assume that
it was typhoid fever; we therefore turned the ship round and
ran for Valparaiso. The prospect of the passage back was
hardly cheerful; I was out certainly for fresh experiences, but
not for the responsibility of nursing typhoid and dysentery at
the same time in a small boat in mid-Pacific. Each twelve hours,
however, was got through somehow, and better on the whole
than might have been expected. S. happily improved, and our
poor geologist himself was wonderfully cheerful and plucky;
the sea was kind to us, and we reached Valparaiso on Sunday
morning with our invalid in a condition which we felt did us
credit. The difficulties of arriving in port with illness on board
proved to be not so great as I, at any rate, had feared; the
authorities were most kind in allowing us to haul down our
yellow flag almost at once, and taking us to a Government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>anchorage. The harbour doctor was found to give the necessary
authority for landing a sick man, while arrangements were
made with the hospital for a stretcher and ambulance, and by
the middle of the afternoon the patient was comfortably on shore
and in bed. The British hospital at Valparaiso is new, reserved
almost entirely for paying patients, and much surpasses in
comfort anything that we have either of us seen in England.
Our diagnosis unfortunately proved to be accurate, but we had
the comfort of knowing that the illness was well understood,
as typhoid is, it appeared, very common in South America,
especially among new-comers. It had been obviously contracted
during the time at Talcahuano, when both Mr. Corry and Mr.
Ritchie had had frequent meals on shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>We waited in port for a week, communicating by cable
with the friends of our patient, and then held a council of war.
The doctor gave it as his opinion that there was no reason for
delay, and it was obviously impossible in such an illness to wait
pending recovery. We had, however, to face the position that
there was a chance, although a slight one, of other cases occurring
on board; hospital records show a percentage of about 3 per cent.
of doctors and nurses infected by patients, and of course our
precautions had, through circumstances, been neither so timely
nor so thorough; with 2,000 miles of Pacific before us we felt
that we could take no risk. On the other hand, we had no wish
for further experiences in hanging about in South American
ports, more especially as smallpox was at this time raging at
Valparaiso. We therefore decided that we would run back
again to Juan Fernandez, and put in a few days in a sort of
quarantine, before finally leaving for our destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>The episode was most disappointing for all concerned; nevertheless
our prevailing feeling was one of thankfulness both for
the sufferer and ourselves, that, if the thing had to be, the illness
had declared itself while we were still within reach of help; the
thought that we were within measurable distance of having a
case of typhoid on Easter Island still makes us shudder. Hopes
were cherished for a while that it might be possible for our
geologist to join us, either when <em>Mana</em> returned or by the Chilean
naval training ship, which it was said might shortly visit the
island. Unfortunately the case proved not only severe, but was
prolonged by relapses, and on recovery the doctor forbade any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>such roughing it. Mr. Corry therefore went back to England,
from whence he sent us a report on the geology of the Patagonian
Channels, and such information as he had gathered on the moot
question of the submergence of a Pacific continent. When war
broke out he was among the first to join His Majesty’s forces, and,
alas! laid down his life for his country in September 1915.
When on our return to London my husband addressed the
Geological Society on the results of the Expedition, our thoughts
naturally turned with sadness to the one who, under other circumstances,
should have had that honour; I sat next to one of
the older Fellows, and he expressed his special sorrow at the
scientific loss caused by the early death of our colleague. “Corry
was,” he said, “quite one of the most promising of the younger
men in the geological world.”</p>

<p>FIG. 20.—JUAN FERNANDEZ: AN IMPRESSION.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='large'>JUAN FERNANDEZ</span></h3>

<p class='c019'>Juan Fernandez was discovered by the navigator of that name on a
voyage from Peru to Chile in 1512. He rightly judged that the
southerly wind, which impeded all navigation in that direction,
might be adjacent only to the mainland; he therefore stood out to
the west in the hope of avoiding it, and so came across the island.
His voyage was so short that he was accused of witchcraft, and
suffered accordingly at the hands of the Inquisition; he was rescued
from its power by the Jesuits, to whom he ceded his rights in the
newly discovered land. The Order founded a colony there, but it
proved a failure. The abandoned island then became the resort of
the buccaneers, who preyed on Spanish commerce, and who used it
to refit their vessels, so that Spanish merchantmen had special orders
to avoid it. The privateers turned down goats to provide meat, on
which the Spaniards imported dogs to kill the goats; these achieved
their purpose on the low ground, but in the hills the goats held
their own, and the battle was therefore a drawn one. It was from
an English privateer that the Scotsman, Alexander Selkirk, was
landed in 1704; while some of the incidents in the life of Robinson
Crusoe, such as those connected with the goats, rats, and cats, were
taken by Defoe from the experiences of Selkirk, he is, if looked upon
as the prototype of the immortal hero, somewhat of a fraud. Not
only is the scene of Crusoe’s adventures laid in the West Indies, but
Selkirk was put on shore at his own request, with such stores as he
required, because he had an objection to the captain. He knew that
sooner or later the place would be visited by some ship coming to
refit, and he was only there altogether four years and four months.
Selkirk reported that he had slit the ears of some of the goats and
let them go; a number of these animals so marked and of “venerable
aspect” were found in 1741 by Anson’s sailors when they arrived
on the island after their passage of the Horn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anson’s own ship, the <em>Centurion</em>, lay in Cumberland Bay for three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>months, during which time two others of the squadron and the
victualler arrived at the rendezvous; the <em>Gloucester</em> had a terrible
experience, being a month within sight of the island with her men
dying daily of scurvy, and unable through contrary winds to make
the anchorage. The crews of the three men-of-war had numbered
on their departure from England 961: only 335 of these were alive
when they left Fernandez. The state of affairs is less surprising
considering that Anson was obliged to take a large consignment of
Chelsea pensioners; the almost incredible age of some of the company
comes out incidentally in the statement that owing to scurvy the
wound of one man reopened which had been received in the battle
of the Boyne fifty years before.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> The island was subsequently
occupied by the Spanish, and after the independence of Chile it was
for a while used as a convict settlement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our time in “quarantine” at Juan Fernandez proved most
enjoyable. We lay in Cumberland Bay, which is the only
anchorage; being on the north side, it is sheltered from the south-east
trade wind. The island is volcanic, but the actual craters
have broken down in course of ages, and their form can no longer
be traced, at least by the superficial observer; it is now a mass
of mountains of striking shapes, interspersed with wooded ravines.
We were able to see certain portions, mounted on ponies, but
much of the ground must be impossible to traverse. S. had a
day’s goat-stalking, but saw only two animals, and those were
out of rifle shot; the ponies, he said, scrambled about like cats,
putting their fore feet on the higher rocks and so dragging themselves
up. The cattle which roam over the island are not infrequently
killed by falling down the precipices. Our meat orders
were executed by four men in a boat armed with rifles, who went
round by sea to some spot where the beasts were likely to be
found, and having shot one cut it up and brought it back. The
result was rather a plethora of Sunday beef even for a yacht’s
hungry crew.</p>

<p><span class='right'>FIG. 22.</span><br><br>SELKIRK’S CAVE, JUAN FERNANDEZ.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>A spot known as Selkirk’s Look-out (fig. 20<span class='fss'>B</span>), on the dividing
ridge of the island, commands glorious views of the other
side and the adjacent island of Santa Clara; to gaze down
from the wooded heights on to the panorama of sea and
land 2,000 feet below seemed like a glimpse into an enchanted
land. The tablet which marks the spot was put up by H.M.S.
<em>Topaze</em> in 1868. We also visited a cave (<span class='fss'>D</span>) which tradition points
out as Selkirk’s first residence, rowing in the boat round cliffs
so steep that a stone dropped from the top would fall more
than 1,000 feet clear into the sea; flights of pigeons wheeled
out from the rocks, looked at us, and went away again. The
landing-place for the cave is somewhat dangerous from the view
of safety to the ship’s boats, being in a cove whose beach is
composed of big boulders. Once on shore the way lies through
a mountain-spur on the right, which has been worn by the force
of the waves into an imposing natural arch. It leads on to a
little lawn at the end of a valley running up into the mountains,
down which flows a small stream. In the hillside is the cave
opening on to the meadow and looking out to sea; the fireplace
is visible, also a shelf cut in the rock and niches to hold utensils.
A prominent feature near the anchorage are six or eight large
caves (<span class='fss'>C</span>), like big halls, the roofs of which are adorned with
drooping ferns, giving the effect of a beautiful greenhouse: if
originally natural they have probably been much enlarged.
They are said to have been used by the Spaniards for their
prisoners. Someone had been digging in the floor for treasure,
under the assumption that it had been left by pirates, presumably
of an earlier day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Juan Fernandez has at present some 300 inhabitants; its
industry is lobster-canning. Lobsters are also taken alive in
the tank of a motor-schooner to Valparaiso, their value growing
<i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> from 2<em>d.</em> each in the island to 3<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em> in the city. The
schooner was also the mail-carrier, and we took a mutual and
friendly interest in one another, as she and <em>Mana</em> were about the
same size. An old gentleman was in charge of the island as
governor, supported by four gendarmes; serious offenders are
exported to the mainland. The means of communication will
shortly be more rapid, as a house was already built to be used for
wireless installation (<span class='fss'>A</span>).</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 9th, 1915, one year precisely from the date we left
the island, the German ship <em>Dresden</em> arrived in Cumberland Bay.
She had been driven by want of coal out of her hiding-places in
the southern channels and sought refuge at Juan Fernandez.
Here after five days she was found by the <em>Glasgow</em> with her
flag still flying. She had many times broken neutrality regulations,
and the Chilean governor with his gendarmes could
scarcely, as will have been seen, be expected to intern her.
The <em>Glasgow</em> fired, the <em>Dresden</em> replied, tried to negotiate, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>blew herself up. The crew had all been landed, and the officers
were conveyed to Chile with the mails and lobsters. Thus in the
twentieth century did Fernandez once again play its part as
a place of resort in time of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>After five days, no illness having appeared, we felt we might
with safety depart, and we started therefore on our 2,000–mile
voyage, the last stage of the outward journey.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='large'>LIFE ON BOARD</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is perhaps as good a time as any to attempt to give a general
impression of life on board the yacht. In the first place it
should be realised that no hardship was involved, and that the
sense of safety, so far from being less, soon became infinitely
greater than on a larger ship. Not only does a small boat ride
over the waves like a cork, but there is the assurance that in
case of accident everyone will know what to do, and orders will
be received without delay; there is plenty of room in the boats,
and the lowering away is known to be a comparatively easy
matter. On first going on board a big liner after being accustomed
to <em>Mana</em>, it felt an alarmingly dangerous means of transit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Existence on any ship has drawbacks in bad weather or
extreme heat, but on the yacht the arrangement by which the
saloon and cabins were connected with the deck-house made the
circulation of air particularly good. A sailing ship is also without
the universal and unpleasant draughts which are omnipresent
in a steamer. In regard to the pleasure of movement there is
of course no comparison between the two.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the food there cannot be the same variety where no
refrigerators are possible, and preserved and salt meats are apt
to become monotonous, but we always left port with as large
a supply of fresh meat as possible, and a few hens and sometimes
a sheep. Preserved vegetables are good, and potatoes could
be carried throughout a voyage, also eggs, and some fruit such
as bananas. With but few exceptions, in very bad weather, we
had bread every day in the cabin and twice a week in the forecastle.
The crew much preferred tinned milk and declined fresh
even when it was available, and for the saloon the unsweetened
variety was quite pleasant. In all other respects the meals
were such as would obtain in any simple household at home.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The routine of ship’s life turns on the watches, the alternate
four hours on and four hours off of the crew. Only in case of
urgency is it permissible to call the watch below, and hence any
deck work, such as altering or shortening sails, when it is not
immediately imperative, waits for the changes of the watch at
8, 12, and at 4, when all the crew are available; those also
are meal hours for the forecastle, with which those of the cabin
must not clash. The afternoon or dog watches are of two hours
only, from 4 to 6 and 6 to 8, in order to secure that the
same hours are not kept on two consecutive days by the same
members of the crew. It is a strange life from the point of view
of the landsman, especially in its bearing on the hours of sleep:
eight hours on and eight hours off duty would have seemed
preferable, but it is the general rule throughout the merchant
service, and the men are accustomed to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>My own daily round began with ordinary domestic duties,
which were seldom accomplished before 11 o’clock. On Saturday
the work took even longer, as, in addition to the usual business
of life, the weekly stores were given out to the forecastle,
and fresh boxes of provisions were fetched up from below and
decanted into tins for shelves; if weather permitted the main
hold was opened. Not only do a marvellous number of small
things need attention on a boat, but every action takes much
longer, owing to the constant movement of the vessel; each article,
for example, has to be put down so that it cannot be overthrown
by a sudden lurch. To my friends who were anxious as to what
we did for exercise, I replied that to give out stores in a rolling
boat, in imminent danger of having the whole contents of a shelf
thrown at one’s head, was an acrobatic performance which involved
sufficient activity to last the twenty-four hours. The same
is also true in degree of every muscular movement, so that the
need was rarely felt for such artificial exercise as deck promenades.
This was as well, for as both the lifeboat and cutter were carried
in the waist of the ship when we were at sea, the space available
for “constitutionals” was prescribed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On certain passages when such a precaution seemed desirable,
as for instance in crossing the Doldrums, the supply of water
was rationed; a gallon per man per day is the allowance, of
which the cook took the morning quota, or half of the whole
amount; in the afternoon everyone produced a quart tin to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>filled (about a fair-sized hot-water can), and this was the private
reserve for washing and drinking. It is wonderful what can be
done with it, and to use a full basin of water for the washing of
hands and then throw it away seems even to-day wicked waste;
the Stewardess was given a double supply, and found it more than
necessary. A new form of philanthropy came into play, when
one member might be overheard saying to another, “Can I let
you have some of my savings, I am really quite well off,” the
savings being <i><span lang="it">aqua pura</span></i>. When rain came every available utensil
was utilised to catch it, and we all suddenly became millionaires.
It must be borne in mind that for many things, such as bathing
and scrubbing down, there was an unlimited supply of salt water,
and a “salt-water soap” proved a great success.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the household duties were over for the time being, the
favourite resort, if the weather was bad or very hot, was in the
deck-house, otherwise it was the after end or poop of the ship.
This space, which was that above the chart-room, and of course
the place of the helm, was raised as in old-fashioned ships, so
that it was almost always dry even if the waist of the ship was
slightly awash. There was no need, nor indeed space, for chairs;
cushions on the deck made satisfactory seats with the steering-gear
casing for a back, or in stormy weather on the top of the
box, with a rope to cling to if necessary. The position had to
be changed of course from time to time if the vessel went over on
the other tack.</p>

<p class='c007'>A certain amount of writing and reading was accomplished,
but not so much as had been expected, for any considerable
roll made them a strain on the eyesight; a monumental piece
of embroidery, which was to have commemorated the voyage,
was brought back practically untouched. Even when no fixed
occupation was possible the hours evaporated marvellously, and
for the first time on a voyage it was a pleasure to see the hands
of the clock put back. There was usually something to observe
going on on deck, and the speed at which the vessel was travelling
was a perennial source of interest: four miles an hour was
fair, six was good, and anything over eight was exciting. The
speed was checked every watch by means of the patent log, a
mechanical screw which trailed behind the vessel and whose
evolutions registered its rapidity; its reckoning, however, became
more than once somewhat surprising, owing to the sharks which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>mistook it for something good to eat, and its bright copper surface
was accordingly painted black. We once nearly secured a
baby shark, which could be seen clearly in the green water
following the salt meat which was being soaked by being towed
overboard; the usual little pilot-fish was in attendance. It
took a bait, but got away with the hook just as it was being
hauled over the rail. This was almost the nearest we came to
success in fishing from the deck, in which we were uniformly
unfortunate, in spite of the fact that all on board were fishermen
and the crew were professionals. Passing bird and marine life
were frequently of interest. Above all the ever-changing ocean
was an immediate neighbour, always claiming attention, whether
it bore a calm blue surface, on which was traced the white line
of the vessel’s course, or resolved itself into a grey mass of tumbling
billows, ever trying to break and again falling back, leaving
little white crests to mark their vain attempt. It is presumably
from this lazy frame of mind on the old sailing vessels that
the idea arose of a voyage as a cure for overwrought nerves; the
present mail steamer, with its hurly-burly of strangers, noisy
children, deck sports, and sweeps on the log may or may not
be a place of entertainment—it can hardly be considered one
of rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the ship’s bell sounded eight bells, or noon, all the hands
which could be spared went below to their dinner, a wonderful
stillness reigned, and the deck was devoted to the solemn ceremonies
of navigation. Three figures, those of the Navigating
Lieutenant, the Sailing-master, and frequently that of S., might
be seen balanced in various attitudes, sextant in hand, endeavouring
to shoot the sun. The most exciting moment of the twenty-four
hours was when the paper was handed in which stated the
exact position of the vessel, and the amount she had done on
her course in the last twenty-four hours. It was naturally
preluded by guesses as to what the result would be, those who
had kept themselves informed of the records of the patent log
having an undue advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hours between luncheon and tea-time were largely devoted
to slumber, and the ship was kept as quiet as possible in order
not to disturb the men who had kept the middle watch the
preceding night; their rest was apparently much more affected
by noise than is generally presumed to be the case with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>non-brain workers. The same sound varies in its effect on
different persons; when it was necessary to use the engine the
Sailing-master complained that he could never sleep with that
“unnatural noise” going on. He altogether refused to allow
that its regular beat might be considered less distracting than
the spasmodic jibing of the ship, with its inevitable accompaniment
of shouting of orders, stamping, and hauling of ropes;
those he maintained were absolutely “natural” sounds. This
recalls the attitude of the cook to cabbage day, which, though
beloved of the men, is, under certain conditions of the elements,
the reverse of pleasant to others on a small vessel, so much so
that on many yachts its recurrence is restricted by the ship’s
articles; <em>Mana’s</em> cook was of the opinion that the smell was
“rather nice”; he evidently considered it a “natural” odour,
which perhaps on the whole was fortunate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most pleasant time of all on deck was after tea; it was
then cool, with the almost daily spectacle of a magnificent sunset.
Sometimes the sinking globe went down amid a glory of clouds,
which turned the sea into a blaze of red and gold; at others
its descent could be traced inch by inch as the ball of fire sank
below the horizon on its road to other lands, leaving behind
it a track of light across the still waters. One evening in
the Pacific the whole sky, east as well as west, was covered with
pink clouds, which found their counterpart in the water below.
It is at times such as sunset, when sky and sea form a joint
panorama, that the dweller on the water truly comes into his
own. In ordinary circumstances, contrary to what might be
expected, the ocean appeals less to the imagination when seen
from shipboard than when viewed from the land; without foreground
or counterbalancing element its restless infinity seems
bewildering to the comprehension. But when at sea the sky
takes up the tale; then the waters below and the firmament above
each find in the other their perfect complement and expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as twilight reigned the gazer was recalled to the
work-a-day world; the navigator came up from the chart-room
to take the ship’s position by the evening star, the junior member
of the watch clambered up the fore-rigging to hang out the ship’s
lights, and so night fell.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the charms of a ship is that she never sleeps. In the
hours of darkness the ordinary habitation relapses to a state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>coma, and to the mental condition of the primitive jelly-fish; a
vessel is always alive, always intelligent. The larger the craft,
the more the vital functions are withdrawn from the common
gaze; in a small yacht they are ever visible as an inseparable
part of the whole. In wakeful nights and from hot cabins, it
is only necessary to stumble up the companion to find the cool
freshness of deck and waking companionship. Silhouetted
against the sky, is the dark figure of the man at the wheel,
somewhere in the gloom is the officer in charge, and for’ard,
though invisible, is the watch on the look-out. The latest news
of wind and progress are to be had for the asking; it is full of
mystery and yet reassuringly practical.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night <em>Mana</em> crossed the Equator is unforgettable; the
yacht, borne along by the newly caught trade wind, raced
through the water with the very poetry of motion. The
full moon made a silver pathway over the sea and lit up
not only the foam from the vessel’s bows, but also her white
sails, which were faintly reflected in the dark sea; the masts
and rigging stood out black against the deep blue sky, while
over all was the Southern Cross. What has been said of
sunset from shipboard is still more true of moonlight and starlight
nights. Then ocean and sky become a whole of marvellous
beauty, and of majesty beyond human ken; always suggesting
questions, always refusing the answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Easter Island at last! It was in the misty dawn of Sunday,
March 29th, 1914, that we first saw our destination, just one week
in the year earlier than the Easter Day it was sighted by Roggeveen
and his company of Dutchmen. We had been twenty
days at sea since leaving Juan Fernandez, giving a wide berth to
the few dangerous rocks which constitute Salo-y-Gomez and
steering directly into the sunset. It was thirteen months since
we had left Southampton, out of which time we had been 147
days under way, and here at last was our goal. As we approached
the southern coast we gazed in almost awed silence at the long
grey mass of land, broken into three great curves, and diversified
by giant molehills (fig. 23). The whole looked an alarmingly
big land in which to find hidden caves. The hush was broken by
the despairing voice of Bailey, the ship’s cook. “I don’t know
how I am to make a fire on that island, there is no wood!”
He spoke the truth; not a vestige of timber or even brushwood
was to be seen. We swung round the western headland with
its group of islets and dropped anchor in Cook’s Bay. A few
hundred yards from the shore is the village of Hanga Roa, the
native name for Cook’s Bay. This is the only part of the island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>which is inhabited, the two hundred and fifty natives, all that
remain of the population, having, been gathered together here
in order to secure the safety of the livestock, to which the rest
of the island is devoted. The yacht was soon surrounded by six
or seven boat-loads of natives, clad in nondescript European
garments, but wearing a head-covering of native straw, somewhat
resembling in appearance the high hat of civilisation (fig. 83).</p>

<p class='c007'>The Manager, Mr. Edmunds, shortly appeared, and to our
relief, for we had not been sure how he would view such an
invasion, gave us a very kind welcome. He is English, and was,
to all intent, at the time of our arrival, the only white man on the
island; a French carpenter, who lived at Hanga Roa with a native
wife, being always included in the village community. His house
is at Mataveri (fig. 25), a spot about two miles to the south of
the village, surrounded by modern plantations which are almost
the only trees on the island; immediately behind it rises the
swelling mass of the volcano Rano Kao. The first meal on
Easter Island, taken here with Mr. Edmunds, remains a lasting
memory. It was a large plain room with uncarpeted floor,
scrupulously orderly; a dinner-table, a few chairs, and two small
book-cases formed the whole furniture. The door on to the
veranda was open, for the night was hot, and the roar of breakers
could be heard on the beach; while near at hand conversation
was accompanied by a never-ceasing drone of mosquitoes. The
light of the unshaded lamp was reflected from the clean rough-dried
cloth of the table round which we sat, and lit up our host’s
features, the keen brown face of a man who had lived for some
thirty years or more, most of it in the open air and under a
tropical sun. He was telling us of events which one hardly
thought existed outside magazines and books of adventure, but
doing it so quietly that, with closed eyes, it might have been
fancied that the entertainment was at some London restaurant,
and we were still at the stage of discussing the latest play.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This house,” said our host, “was built some fifty years ago
by Bornier, who was the first to exploit the island. He was
murdered by the natives: they seized the moment when he was
descending from a ladder; one spoke to him and another struck
him down. They buried him on the hillock near the cliff just
outside the plantation: you will see his grave, when the grass
is not so long; it is marked by a circle of stones. A French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>warship arriving almost immediately afterwards, they explained
that he had been killed by a fall from his horse, and this is the
version still given in some of the accounts of the island, but
murder will always out. After that another manager had
trouble: it was over sheep-stealing. There were three or four
white men here at the time, and they all rode down to the village
to teach the natives a lesson, but the ponies turned restive at the
sound of gun-fire, and the rifles themselves were defective, so the
boot was on the other foot, and they had to retreat up here
followed by the mob; for months they lived in what was practically
a state of siege, with one man always on guard for fear of
attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My latest guests were a crew of shipwrecked mariners,
Americans, who landed on the island last June. A fortnight
earlier the barometer here had been extraordinarily low, but
we did not get much wind; further to the south, however, the
gale was terrific, and the <em>El Dorado</em> was in the midst of it.
The captain, who had been a whaler in his day, said that he had
never seen anything approaching it, the sea was simply a seething
mass of crested waves. The ship was a schooner, trading between
Oregon and a Chilean port; she was a long way from land, as
sailing vessels make a big semicircle to get the best wind. She
had a deck load of timber, 15 feet high, which of course shifted
in such a sea; she sprang leaks in every direction, and it was
obvious that she must soon break up. The crew took to their
boat, not that they had much hope of saving their lives, but
simply because there was nothing else to be done. They got
some tins of milk and soup on board, and a box of biscuits, and
a cask holding perhaps twenty gallons of water. The captain
managed to secure his sextant, but when he went back for his
chronometers, the chart-room was too deep in water for him to
be able to reach them. They saw by the chart that the nearest
land was this island: it was seven hundred miles off, and as they
had no chronometer, and could take no risks, they would have to
go north first in order to get their latitude, which would add on
another two hundred. There was nothing for it, however, but
to do the best they could; they had more gales too, and only
saved the boat from being swamped by making a sea-anchor of
their blankets. The spray of course kept washing over them,
and as the boat was only 20 feet long and there were eleven of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>them, there was no room for them to lie down. Each day they
had between them a tin of the soup and one of milk, and an
allowance of water, but the sea got into the water-cask and made
it brackish, and before the end their sufferings from thirst were
so great that one or two of them attempted to drink salt water;
the mate stopped that by saying that he would shoot the first
man who did it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After nine days they sighted this island, but then
luck was against them, for the wind changed, and it was forty-eight
hours, after they saw the coast, before they were able to
beach the boat. They got on shore at the other end of the
island, which is uninhabited. They were pretty much at the
last stage of exhaustion, and their skin was in a terrible condition
with salt water; their feet especially were so bad that they could
hardly walk. One of them fell down again and again, but
struggled on saying, ‘I won’t give up, I won’t give up.’ At
last my man, who looks after the cattle over there, saw them
and brought me word. The officers were put up here, you must
really forgive the limitations of my wardrobe, for I had to give
away nearly everything that I had in order to clothe them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The most curious part of the whole business was that after
they had been here three or four months the captain took to the
boat again. I believe that he was buying his house at home
on the instalment plan, and that if he did not get in the last
payment by the end of the year the whole would be forfeited;
anyway, as soon as the fine weather came on he had out the boat
and patched her up. He got two of his men to go with him. I
lent him a watch for navigation purposes, and we did all we could
for him in the way of food; there were no matches on the island,
so he learnt how to make fire with two pieces of wood native
fashion. Anyway, off he started last October for Mangareva,
sixteen hundred miles from here; he must have got there safely,
for you brought me an answer to a letter that I gave him to post.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>But,” and here for the first time the eyes of our host grew animated,
and he raised his voice slightly, “it is maddening to
think of that cargo drifting about in the Pacific. I do trust that
next time a ship breaks up with a deck-load of timber, she will
have at least the commonsense to do so near Easter Island.”
Then, after a pause, “I wish you no ill, but the yacht would make
a splendid wreck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We kept <em>Mana</em> for nearly two months while learning our new
surroundings. Not only were we anxious to find if we had the
necessary camp gear and stores, but we were engaged in agonised
endeavours to foresee the details of excavation and research, in
case essential tools or equipment had been forgotten, which
the yacht could fetch from Chile. The time, however, arrived
when she must go. Mr. Ritchie was now on shore with us
for survey work, but as his service with the Expedition was
limited, the vessel had to return in time to take him back to
civilisation by the correct date. Mr. Gillam had from this time
sole charge of the navigation of <em>Mana</em>. Instructions for him had
to be written, and correspondence grappled with; business
letters, epistles for friends, and reports to Societies were hurriedly
dealt with; and an article which had been promised to the
<cite>Spectator</cite>, “First Impressions of Easter Island,” was written in
my tent, by the light of a hurricane-lamp, during the small hours
of more than one morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the mail-bag was finally sealed, there was great
difficulty in getting hold of <em>Mana</em>. The position of a skipper
of a boat off Easter Island, unless she has strong steam power,
is not a happy one. Mr. Gillam used to lie in his berth at
Cook’s Bay hearing the waves break on the jagged reaches of
lava, and the longer he listened the less he liked it. The
instant that the wind shows signs of going to the west, a ship
must clear out. It is reported that on one occasion there were
some anxious moments on board: a sudden change of wind
and tide were setting the yacht steadily on the rocks; the
engineer was below in the engine-room, and Mr. Gillam shouted
to him down the hatchway, “If you can’t make that motor
of yours go round in three minutes, you will know whether there
is a God or not.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>To get in touch with the yacht was like a game of hide-and-seek,
for often by the time those on shore arrived at one side of
the island, the wind had shifted, and she had run round to the
other. She was on the north coast when we managed to catch
her, and to get back to Mataveri necessitated retracing our steps,
as will be seen from the map, over the high central ground of the
island, and down on the other side; the track was rough, and
the ride would ordinarily take from two to three hours. It was
4 p.m. before all work was done on board, the good-byes said,
and we were put on shore; the sandy cove, the horses and men,
with <em>Mana</em> in the offing, formed a delightful picture in the
evening light, but there the charms of the situation ended.
There was only one pack-horse, and a formidable body of last
collections sat looking at us in a pile on the grass. In addition
we had not, in the general pressure, sufficiently taken into
account that we were bringing off the engineer, now to be turned
into photographer; there he was, and not he alone but his goods
and bedding. The sun set at five o’clock, and it would be dark
at half-past five; it seemed hopeless to get back that night.</p>

<p class='c007'>A neighbouring cave was first investigated as a possible
abiding-place, but proved full of undesirable inhabitants, so
everyone set to work and the amount stowed on that wretched
pack-horse was wonderful. Then each attendant was slung
round with some remaining object, S. took the additional
member on his pony, and off we set. Before we got to the
highest point all daylight had gone, and there was only just
enough starlight to keep to the narrow track by each man following
a dim vision of the one immediately in front. My own beast
had been chosen as “so safe” that it was most difficult to keep
him up with the others, let alone on his four legs. The pack-horse,
too, began pointing out that he was not enjoying the
journey; the load was readjusted more than once, but when we
were on the down grade again he came to a full stop and we all
dismounted. There in the creepy darkness we had a most
weird picnic; not far off was a burial-place, with a row of fallen
statues, while the only light save that of the stars was the striking
of an occasional match. S. produced a tin of meat, which he
had brought from the yacht, and which was most acceptable, as
he and I had had no substantial food, save a divided tin of
sardines, since breakfast at 7 o’clock. He shared it out
between the party amid cries from our retainers of “Good food,
good Pappa,” for we were, as in East Africa, known as “Pappa”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and “Mam-ma” to a large and promising family. By
some inducement the pack-horse was then deluded into proceeding,
and we finally reached Mataveri at nine o’clock, relieved
to find we had not been given up and that supper awaited us.
So did we cut our last link with civilisation, and were left in
mid-Pacific with statues and natives.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next part of this story deals with the island, the conditions
of life on it, and our experience during the sixteen months we
were to spend there. Such scientific work as the Expedition
was able to accomplish will be recounted later.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='large'>CONDITIONS OF LIFE ON THE ISLAND</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Easter is a volcanic land, and in the earliest days of the world’s
history great lights and flowing lava must have gleamed across
the expanse of water, then gradually lessened and died away,
leaving their work to be moulded by wind and tide. The island,
as the forces of nature have thus made it, is triangular in shape
and curiously symmetrical. The length of the base—that is,
of the south, or strictly speaking south-east, coast—is about
thirteen miles, and the greatest width about seven miles; the
circumference, roughly speaking, is thirty-four miles. The apex,
which is the highest ground, is a volcano over 1,700 feet in height
whose summit is formed of a cluster of small craters; the eastern
and western angles are each composed of a large extinct volcano.
The place is geologically young, and the mountains, in contrast
to those of Juan Fernandez, still preserve their original rounded
shape; there are no ravines, no wooded precipices, no inaccessible
heights, but round the whole coast erosion is at work, with the
result that, while on the land side the slopes of all these three
mountains are gradual, on the sea side—that is, in portions of
the north, east, and west coasts respectively—they have been
worn back by the power of the waves into imposing cliffs. In
the lower districts the sheets of lava form a shore line of some
50 to 100 feet in height, and extend into the sea in black, broken
ridges. Against this coast of alternating high cliffs and jagged
rocks the swell of the Pacific is always dashing, and in a high
wind clouds of white spray first hide, and then reveal, the inhospitable
shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The comparatively level and low-lying regions of the island,
namely, those which are not covered by the three great volcanoes,
consist of the south coast, and of two tracts which run
across the island on either side. The high ground which forms
the apex of the triangle is thus divided from that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>eastern and western angles respectively. Another level strip,
some quarter of a mile wide at its broadest, lies in an elevated
and romantic position around the northern apex between the
highest portion of the central mountain and the precipitous sea-cliff.
This distribution of the level ground is, as will be later
seen, reflected in the disposition of the various clans which
formerly spread over the island (fig. 91).</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the three large mountains, there are smaller
elevations some hundreds of feet in height, generally in the form
of cones with craters distinctly visible. These lesser volcanoes,
with one or two exceptions, may be roughly said to lie in two lines
which radiate irregularly from the northern eminence, spreading
out from it like fingers and pointing respectively to the east and
west ends of the south coast. The hills, which may be termed the
root of the fingers, form part of the high ground, while those
equivalent to the tips rise out of the low-lying portion, where
the east and west transverse belts join the southern plain.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some instances the crater of a mountain has become a lake:
when this is the case the term “rano” is prefixed to its name.
It is quaintly told that one visitor, considering the volcanic
origin, hazarded the suggestion that “rano” was equivalent
to fire, to which the natives indignantly replied that, on the
contrary, it meant water. These lakes are almost the only
water-supply of the island: there is a good rainfall, but no single
running stream. Owing to the porous nature of the ground the
water sinks beneath the surface, sometimes forming underground
channels from which it flows into the sea below high-water mark:
thus giving rise to the curious statement of early voyagers that
the natives were able to drink salt water<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> (fig. 124). The lower
portions of the island are composed of sheets of lava, in process
of disintegration, across which walking is almost impossible and
riding a very slow process; the surface of the mountains and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>hills is smoother, being volcanic ash. The whole is covered with
grass, which sprouts up between the masses of lava and gives the
hills a delightful down-like appearance. Forest growth has
probably never consisted of more than brushwood and shrubs,
and to-day even those have disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best panorama of the island is obtained from the western
volcano, by name Rano Kao (fig. 24). Below on the left lies
Cook’s Bay, with Mataveri and the village of Hanga Roa,
and beyond them the high bleak central ground of the island,
generally known by the name of one of its craters, Rano Aroi.
On the right is the plain of the south coast, culminating in the
eastern headland, a district the greater part of which is known
as Poike. Just in front of the headland can be seen the two
peaks of the mountain of Rano Raraku, from which the statues
were hewn and which is the most interesting place in the
island; while on a clear day there can be obtained a glimpse
of the northern coast and the sea beyond.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such is Easter Island. It bears no resemblance to the ideal
lotus-eating lands of the Pacific; rather, with its bleak grass-grown
surface, its wild rocks and restless ocean, it recalls some
of the Scilly Isles or the coast of Cornwall. It is not a beautiful
country nor even a striking one, but it has a fascination of
its own. All portions of it are accessible; from every part are
seen marvellous views of rolling country; everywhere is the
wind of heaven; around and above all are boundless sea and
sky, infinite space and a great silence. The dweller there is
ever listening for he knows not what, feeling unconsciously
that he is in the antechamber to something yet more vast
which is just beyond his ken.</p>

<p class='c007'>The objects of antiquarian interest proved to be widely scattered.
The statues have originally stood on a particular kind of burial-place,
generally known as a “terrace” or “platform.” These
terraces surround the whole coast, and each one had of course
to be studied. For those at the western end, and for certain
stone remains on the volcano of Rano Kao, Mataveri was a most
convenient centre; but the distance from there to the places of
interest at the other end of the island was unduly great. We
therefore decided to avail ourselves of the offer of the Manager
and remain for a while at his establishment, where <em>Mana</em> left
us, and later move camp. Survey and photography had of course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>to keep pace with research, and a general look-out to be kept
for any caves which it might pay to explore. There was also
the question of getting into touch with the natives and finding
if any lore existed which threw light on the antiquities: this
last, from what we had been told in England, was not a very
hopeful quest; anyway, it seemed wiser to defer it for the moment
till we knew something of the language and were more at home
in our surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Manager’s house has six rooms, three of which are at
the front, and three, having a separate entrance, at the back.
These last, with a most useful attic, Mr. Edmunds kindly put
at our disposal, and we supplemented the accommodation with
tents pitched in the grounds. My own tent, for the sake of
quietness, was on the western side of the plantation, about a
hundred yards from the house. S. used to escort me down
at night, with a camp lantern, by a little track through the
eucalyptus trees, see that all was well, put down the light,
and leave me with the mystery of the island. The site was one
dedicated to cannibal feasts; immediately behind was the
hillock with the grave of the murdered manager; while not
far away the waves thundered against the cliffs, making in
stormy weather the ground tremble as if with an earthquake.
In the morning came the glory of the waking, of being at once
<i><span lang="fr">tête à tête</span></i> with air, sunshine, and dewy grass: to those who have
not known the wonder of these things, it cannot be explained; to
those who have experienced it, no words are needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tent life is not all “beer and skittles”; Easter is too windy
for an ideal camping-ground; my pitch was sheltered, but even
so it seemed at times as if the structure would be carried away
bodily. To preserve a tent in place taut ropes are needed, but
if rain descends these shrink, and either burst with the strain
or tear the pegs out of the ground: the conscientious dweller
under canvas will, under these conditions, arise from his warm
bed, and in the pouring deluge race round the tent, slacking off
the said ropes. Mine, like the stripes of St. Paul, numbered
forty save one. Before the end we were able to make different
arrangements.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we had been some three and a half months at Mataveri—that
is, in the middle of July 1914—we felt that the time had
come to begin work on the other end of the island. It must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>remembered that our original idea was that six months would
probably suffice for the whole inquiry, and in any case we had no
intention of staying beyond the period which would allow of
<em>Mana’s</em> making a second trip to Chile.</p>

<p class='c007'>We therefore established ourselves at Rano Raraku as the
most convenient site. It takes about two hours to ride there
from Mataveri. The road is made, like all those in the island,
by simply clearing away the stones, but it is wide enough to
permit the passage of a wagon. It leads first across the island
by the western transverse plain till, at Vaihu, the sea is reached,
then runs along the south coast with its low rocks and continuous
line of breaking surf. Every step of this part of the way is
marked, for those who have eyes to see, with ruined burial-places;
many of them strewn with the remains of the statues which
have once been erected upon them. As Raraku is approached,
there lie by the roadside isolated figures of portentous size,
abandoned, it has been thought, in the act of removal from the
quarries to the terraces. We grew to know by heart this road,
which led from what we termed our “town establishment,” to our
“country house,” and have ridden it, together or separately, at all
hours and in every weather. We were not infrequently detained
by business, at one end or the other, till too late to save the
daylight, and after dark it was not easy to keep to the track,
even with the help afforded by the sound of the breakers. Our
ponies gave us no assistance in the difficulty, for as foals they
had run wild with their mothers, and were, therefore, equally
happy wandering off among the fields of broken lava. As the
“twilight of the dove” gradually changed to the “twilight of
the raven,” and the huge figures loomed larger than ever in the
gathering gloom, it seemed that, if ever the spirits of the departed
revisit their ancient haunts, the ghosts of the old image-makers
must be all abroad about their works and places of burial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rano Raraku (fig. 45) stands by itself where the flat ground of
the southern coast meets the eastern transverse plain, and forms
the isolated tip of those lesser volcanoes which have been described
as the eastern finger. About a mile to the eastward
rises the high ground of Poike. Raraku scarcely deserves the
name of mountain, being little more than a basin containing a
crater lake; yet it curiously dominates the scene. There will
be much to tell of it hereafter; for the moment suffice it to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>say that a large number of statues stand on its lower slopes,
while above are the quarries from which, with very few
exceptions, all the figures in the island have been obtained.
The side nearest the sea is a sheer cliff, the extremities of
which form the two peaks which are so characteristic of the
mountain. Beneath the cliff is a flow of lava; here the
French carpenter had managed to put up two iron huts which
had been sent ahead from England; one was a store, the
other formed my one-roomed villa residence. Their erection
was somewhat of a triumph, as all the bolts had been stolen
on the way. The rest of the camp, the tent for meals, that
of S., and those for the servants, were pitched for protection
about 50 feet lower down, on the further side of the lava flow;
but even here, owing to the tearing wind which howled round
the mountain, their canvas flies had to be tied back and walls
erected around them (fig. 73). On every hand were the remains
of native life prior to the removal of the inhabitants to Hanga
Roa, the most welcome being a single well-grown tree of the sort
known in tropical countries as the “umbrella tree.” It was the
only example of its kind on the island, and was of an age that
suggested it had been planted by the early missionaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole situation was not only one of striking beauty,
but brought with it an indescribable sense of solemnity. Immediately
above the camp towered the majestic cliff of Raraku,
near at hand were its mysterious quarries and still erect statues;
on the coast below us, quiet and still, lay the overturned images
of the great platform of Tongariki, one fragment of which alone
remains on its base, as a silent witness to the glory which has
departed. The scene was most wonderful of all when the full
moon made a track of light over the sea, against which the black
mass of the terrace and the outline of the standing fragment
were sharply defined; while the white beams turned the waving
grass into shimmering silver and lit up every crevice in the
mountain above.</p>

<p class='c007'>Easter Island lies in the sub-tropics, and, if the question of
wind be eliminated, the climate is as near perfection as possible
in this world. There may be, especially in the winter months,
a spell of three or four days of rain, or a wind from the Antarctic,
when woollen clothes are welcome; and occasionally, in the
summer, it is preferable to be indoors during the noontide hours;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>but with these exceptions, it is one of those rare localities where
it is possible to be warm the whole year round, and yet to utilise
to the full the hours of daylight. There are, as might be expected,
too many insects; cockroaches abound, out of doors and under
statues as well as in houses and tents; when things were very bad
they might even be seen on the dinner-table. I was calmly
told, with masculine insensibility, that “if I had not naturally
a taste for such things, the sooner that I acquired it
the better”; the only consolation was that they were of a
handsome red variety and not shiny black. Flies also are
numerous; I have counted two hundred in a bowl of soapy
water, and six or eight at once on my hand while busy
writing; “their tameness was shocking to me.” Mosquitoes,
which have been imported, varied in their attentions; when they
were at their worst it was necessary to wear head-gear and dine
in gloves. There is said to be no fever in the islands; we had
two or three attacks, but it may have been “original sin.”
Once we had a plague of little white moths, and occasionally, for
a short while, visitations of a small flying beetle, whose instinct
seemed to be to crawl into everything, making it safer to stuff
one’s ears with cotton-wool. On these occasions dinner had to
be put earlier, owing to Bailey’s pathetic complaint that, with
a lamp burning in the kitchen, business was rendered impossible
from the crowds which committed suicide in the soup.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lack of firewood was met by using oil; when, later, we
had to economise in that commodity, it was supplemented by
collecting dried manure. The natives use brushwood or anything
they can pick up; their manner of cooking, which is after
Polynesian fashion by heating stones placed in the earth, requires
very little fuel. The water difficulty was ever present. At the
Mataveri establishment the supply collected from the roof was
generally sufficient; we arrived, however, in a dry spell, and
one morning the request for water was met by the information
that the “tank was empty”; even <em>Mana</em>, one felt, had never
fallen quite so low. It was consoling to be informed that “clothes
could always be washed in the crater,” a climb of 1,300 feet.
At our Raraku camp all the water, except that which could be
collected on the roof of a tin hut, had to be fetched from the
crater lake; this rendered us tiresomely dependent on getting
native labour. The rain-clouds are often intercepted by the high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>grounds at the south-western end of the island, in a manner
which is most tantalising to the dweller in the eastern, if supplies
happen to be low.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ranch supported at this time about 12,000 sheep, 2,000
head of cattle, and other livestock; we were generously supplied
with milk and could purchase any quantity of mutton:
beef was not often killed for so small a party. Chickens of a lean
species were sometimes available. <em>Mana</em> later brought Mr.
Edmunds some turkeys which did well. Bananas were useful,
when in season. Fig-trees thrive, and we had a lavish and most
acceptable supply at Raraku of this fruit from those planted by
the natives prior to their removal to Hanga Roa. Vegetables
were scarce, as the Manager took no interest in his garden, owing
to the depredations of the natives, and we had no time for their
cultivation. Groceries had, of course, been brought with us,
and on our arrival they were deposited in the locked and strongly
built wool-shed at Hanga Piko, a small boat landing between
Hanga Roa and Mataveri. Housekeeping was a much easier
business than on the yacht, but S.’s share of practical work was
considerably greater, for, beside the initial camp-pitching, all
tent or kitchen gear that went wrong and every lamp which
would not burn made demands on his time. In his department
also came the stud; we had been kindly provided with some of
the island ponies, of which there are about five hundred; as
export is impossible, the value of each animal is put at 5s.
When not in use the steeds were put out to graze as best they
might; and in addition to the care of the saddlery, every tethering
rope which chafed through against the stones was brought for
repair to the head of the Expedition. In judging of scientific
work under such conditions, it must always be borne in mind how
many hours and days are thus inevitably consumed in practical
labour.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was, luckily for us, the one skilled workman on the
island, the French carpenter who had made his way from New
Caledonia; his name was Vincent, but he answered to the
appellation of “Varta” (the figure in fig. 37); the difficulty
was to obtain his services as he was constantly employed on the
estate. One of our few retainers, Mahanga (fig. 89), was not
a native of Easter, but had come from the Paumotu Islands;
he served faithfully for many months, the goal in view being the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>possession of one of the tin huts, which passed into his keeping
when we left the island. It was related that having been at one
time afflicted with some skin disease, he had taken the heroic
remedy of plunging into a vat in which the sheep were being
dipped, with painful but beneficial results. The native girls
make quite tolerable servants, and I was fortunate in never
being without one (fig. 29). They take a keen interest in their
own clothes and some of them are surprisingly good needlewomen;
in some of the houses there are even sewing-machines.
But to obtain labour, whether for camp work or excavation,
was always difficult, and for a while circumstances rendered it
almost impossible.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XI<br> <span class='large'>A NATIVE RISING</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was stated a little while back that we were left on the island
with statues and natives. The statues remained quiescent, the
natives did not. The inhabitants, or Kanakas to give them their
usual name<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> (fig. 26), are on the whole a handsome race, though
their voices, particularly those of the women, are very harsh.
They are fortunate also in possessing attractive manners, from
which they get the full benefit in their intercourse with passing
ships. The older people we found always kind and amiable, but
the younger men have a high opinion of their own merits, and
are often difficult to deal with. Their general morality, using
the word in its limited sense, is, in common with that of all
Polynesians, of a particularly low order; it is true that the Europeans
with whom they have come into contact did not initiate
this condition, but they have seldom done anything to show that
that of their own lands is in any way higher; a fact which should
be remembered when complaint is made that Kanakas “have
no respect for white men.” The native love of accuracy also
leaves a good deal to be desired, and their lies are astonishingly
fluent; but lack of truthfulness is scarcely confined to Kanakas.
In common with all residents in the South Seas, or indeed
elsewhere, they exert themselves no more than is necessary to
supply their wants; unfortunately these, save in the matter of
clothes, have scarcely increased since pre-Christian days. The
food-supply of sweet potatoes and bananas, with a few pigs and
fowls, can be obtained with a minimum of labour; the keeping
of sheep and cattle is not permitted by the Company, owing to
the impossibility of discovering or tracing theft. Their old huts,
which were made with sticks and grass, have been replaced by
small houses of wood or stone, but, except in a few cases, there
is no furniture, and the inhabitants continue to sleep on the
floor, in company with hens, which freely run in and out (fig. 27).
There seems no desire to improve their condition; “Kanakas no
like work, Kanakas like sit in house,” was the ingenuous reply
given by one of them, when my husband pointed out the good
results which would accrue from planting some trees in village
territory.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Perhaps the greatest barrier to native progress lies in the
absence of security of property; they steal freely from one
another, as well as from white men, so that all individual effort
is rendered nugatory. At the same time they are curiously
lacking in pugnacity, and if detected in theft quietly desist or
return the property: as a typical instance our cook once met a
man wearing one of his, Bailey’s, ties; he looked steadily at him,
the man’s hand went up, he took off the tie and handed it back.
Their own native organisation was peculiarly lax, no kind of
justice being administered, and they have never had for any
duration the civilising effect of religious instruction or civil
power. The missionaries were replaced by a native lay reader;
there is a large church where services are regularly held, which
form important functions for the display of best clothes, but it
is difficult to say how much they convey to the worshippers.
The older ones, at any rate, have two names, both a native and
Christian appellation. Mr. Edmunds had, on our arrival, the
status of a Chilean official, and was both just and kind in his
dealings, but he had no means of enforcing order; the two policemen
who had been at one time on the island had been withdrawn
owing to their own bad conduct. The marvel is not that the
Kanakas are troublesome, but that they are as good as they are.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had heard in Chile rumours of native unrest, owing to the
action of a white man, who had been for a short while on the
island, and who had done his best to undermine the authority
of the Manager. We had before long unpleasant evidence that
they were out of hand. The wool-shed, which contained our
minutely calculated stores, was broken into, and a quantity of
things stolen, the most lamented being three-fourths of the stock
of soap; no redress or punishment was possible. On June 30th,
while we were still at the Manager’s, a curious development
began which turned the history of the next five weeks into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Gilbertian opera—a play, however, with an undercurrent of
reality which made the time the most anxious in the story of
the Expedition. On that date a semi-crippled old woman,
named Angata (fig. 30), came up to the Manager’s house accompanied
by two men, and informed him that she had had a dream
from God, according to which M. Merlet, the chairman of the
Company, was “no more,” and the island belonged to the
Kanakas, who were to take the cattle and have a feast the
following day.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Our party also was to be laid under contribution,
which, it later transpired, was to take the form of my clothes.
Later in the day the following declaration of war was formally
handed in to Mr. Edmunds, written in Spanish as spoken on the
island:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c022'>

<p class='c008'>“Now I declare to you, by and by we declare to you,
which is the word we speak to-day, but we desire to take all the
animals in the camp and all our possessions in your hands, now,
for you know that all the animals and farm in the camp belong
to us, our Bishop Tepano gave to us originally. He gave it to
us in truth and justice. There is another thing, the few animals

another thing, to-morrow we are going out into the camp to
fetch some animals for a banquet. God for us, His truth and
justice. There is also another business, but we did not receive
who gave the animals to Merlet also who gave the earth to Merlet
because it is a big robbery. They took this possession of ours,
and they gave nothing for the earth, money or goods or anything
else. They were never given to them. Now you know all that

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If some of the arguments are probably without foundation,
as, for example, that regarding native rights in the cattle, they
were at least, as will be seen, of the same kind which have inspired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>risings in many lands and all ages. The delivery of the document
was immediately followed by action. The Kanakas went into
“the camp,” eluding Mr. Edmunds, who had gone in another
direction, and secured some ten head of cattle. The smoke from
many fires was shortly to be seen ascending from the village, and
one of our party was shown a beast which was to be offered to us
in place of our stolen property, “God” having apparently
reversed his message on the subject of our contribution to the
new republic. The next few days there was little more news
“from the front,” save that Angata, the old woman, had had
another dream, in which God had informed her that “He was
very pleased that the Kanakas had eaten the meat and they
were to eat some more.” A week later, riding home through
the village, I saw a group on the green engaged in dressing a
girl’s hair; on inquiry it was found that she was to be married
next day. Congratulations had hardly been expressed, when
another young woman was pointed out who was also to change
her state at the same time, and another and another, till the
prospective brides totalled five in all. The idea, it seemed, was
prevalent, that if punishment was subsequently inflicted for the
raids, it was the single men who would be taken to Chile, hence
this rush into matrimony, undeterred by the fact that Mr.
Edmunds, in his capacity as Chilean official, had declined for
the present to perform the civil part of the ceremony. The
wedding feast was, of course, to be furnished by the sheep of the
Company. Unfortunately, under such circumstances, it seemed
hardly loyal to our host to attend the multiple wedding, which
was duly solemnised in the church next day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, the white residents had, of course, been considering
their position, and in orthodox fashion, counting the number on
which they could rely in an emergency. Beside Mr. Edmunds
there were at this time in our party, myself and five men:
S., Mr. Ritchie, the photographer, the cook, and a boy from
Juan Fernandez. There were about half a dozen more or less
reliable Kanakas, including the native Overseer and the village
Headman, but everyone else was involved. Mr. Edmunds’s
position as custodian of the livestock was unenviable, and ours
was not much more pleasant. After much thought we strongly
dissuaded him from taking any action; if he interfered, there
would be an affray. The natives were said to have a rifle and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>some pistols; it was doubtful how many would go off, but there
would anyway be stone-throwing: if he was then forced to
shoot, the only deterrent possible, he would have to continue
till resistance was entirely cowed, or all our lives would remain
in danger. His personal safety was however another matter,
and our party therefore accompanied him in an attempt to
frustrate a raid, but this obviously could not be continued if
our work was to be accomplished. We were strengthened in
adopting a waiting policy by the fact that, most fortunately, a
fortnight earlier a passing vessel had left us newspapers; they
confirmed the news heard in Chile that the naval training ship,
the <em>Jeneral Baquedano</em>, whose visits occurred at intervals of
anything from two to five years, was shortly leaving for Easter
Island. We could only hope her arrival would be soon.</p>

<p class='c007'>S. suggested that, being an unofficial person, he might
meanwhile try the effect of negotiations; for the raids were
continuing, and the head of cattle killed on one day had risen
to fifty-six, including females and young. He therefore went
down to the village, assembled the natives, and offered the
company a present of two bullocks a week, if they would refrain
from taking any more stock till the arrival of the warship, when
the whole matter could be referred to the captain. The audience
laughed the suggestion out of court, for “the whole of the cattle,”
they said, belonged to them, as God had told Angata, but they
would let our party “have twenty” if we wished; as for Mr.
Edmunds, “he is a Protestant, and therefore, of course, has no
God.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>When my husband returned saying he had accomplished
nothing, I felt that it was “up to me.” “This,” I said, “is a
matter requiring tact, and is therefore a woman’s job; <em>I</em> will go
and see the old lady.” I had already received from her an
embarrassing present of fowls, which, after referring the matter
to our host, it had seemed better to accept. Not without inward
trepidation, I rode down to the village, taking the Fernandez
boy as interpreter, for many of the natives speak a smattering
of Spanish. The place was a perfect shambles, joints of meat
hanging from all the trees, and skins being pegged out to dry on
every hand, but the raiders had been displaying energy in rebuilding
the wall round the church. The Prophetess was with
a group outside the house of the acting priest, who was her
son-in-law; she was a frail old woman with grey hair and expressive
eyes, a distinctly attractive and magnetic personality.
She wore suspended round her neck some sort of religious medallion,
a red cross, I think, on a white ground, and her daughter
who supported her carried a small picture of the Saviour in an
Oxford frame. She held my hand most amiably during the
interview, addressing me as “Caterina.” I had brought her a
gift and began by thanking for the fowls. She refused all payments,
saying “Food comes from God, I wish for no money,”
and proceeded to offer me some of the meat. This gave an
opening, and in declining I besought her not to let the Kanakas
go out again after the animals, for Mr. Edmunds said he would
shoot if they did, and there would be trouble for them when the
<em>Baquedano</em> came. As I spoke of the raids her face hardened and
her eyes took the look of a fanatic; she said something about
“God” with the upward gesture which was her habit in speaking
His name. I hastened to relieve the tension by saying that
“We must all worship God,” and was happy to find that I was
allowed a share in the Deity. Her manner again softened, and
looking up to heaven she declared, with an assured confidence,
which was in its way sublime, “God will never let the Kanakas
be either killed or hurt.” The natives were, in fact, firmly persuaded
that no bullet could injure them. As for myself, Angata
would, she said, “pray” for me, adding, with a descent to the
mundane, that if ever she had “chickens or potatoes,” I should
be the first to have them. It was impossible to reason further;
we parted the best of friends, but the “tactful” mission had
failed!</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the state of affairs when we decided that we must
transfer our work and consequently our belongings to the other end
of the island. Our surveyor and photographer remained, however,
at Mataveri, as the accommodation there was more convenient
for their occupations, so Mr. Edmunds was not alone. Moving
camp, levelling ground, and building walls, were not light matters,
when the Kanakas had found such much more interesting
employment, but at last it was accomplished, and then came
the question of the stores, which after the robbery at the wool-shed
had been taken to Mataveri. After much consultation it
was decided to remove them to Raraku, as on the whole safer
than leaving them at the Manager’s house, which might, by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>look of things, be any day looted or burnt down. But when the
ox-cart had been carefully loaded up with the numerous boxes
and goods, the cash supply, consisting of £50 of English gold
and some Chilean paper, being carefully hidden amongst them,
a spell of bad weather set in. It was impossible to move the
cart, and our possessions sat there day after day most handily
arranged for the revolutionists if their desires should turn that
way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our new camp we were often obliged to leave without
defence save for the redoubtable Bailey, who had also served as
guard at Mataveri (fig. 28). There had been no demonstration
against us so far, but of course the future was unknown, and I
never came in sight of our house, on returning from any distant
work, without casting an anxious glance to see if it were still
standing. We always went about armed, and the different
ranges for rifle-shot were measured off from my house and marked
by cairns, which will no doubt in future add yet one more to the
mysteries of Easter Island.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day I had just come back from a stroll, when the cry was
raised “The Kanakas are coming,” and a troop of horsemen,
about thirty strong, appeared on the sky-line some four hundred
yards distant. Fortunately S. was at hand, we hurried inside
my house, shut the lower half of its door, which resembled that
of a loose-box, and carelessly leant out. Any unpleasantness
could then only be frontal; at the same time all weapons were
within easy grasp, though not visible from the outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>It soon, however, became clear that the visitors were approaching
at a walk only, from which it was gathered their intentions
were friendly. Nevertheless it was a relief when, as they got
nearer, they raised their hats and gave a cheer; they then
formed a semicircle round the door and dismounted. The
“priest” who was with them, and who carried a picture of the
Virgin, read something, presumably a prayer, at which the
company crossed themselves. He then gave greetings from
Angata, and a message from her to say that <em>Mana</em> was returning
safely with letters on board, and the men presented from their
saddle-bows, eggs, potatoes, and about a dozen hens. The
position was unwelcome, but as none of the goods were stolen,
it seemed better to accept, and discharge the obligation as far as
possible by giving in return what European food we could spare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>We subsequently informed Mr. Edmunds, and sent a message
to the Prophetess that, as our camp was out of bounds, the
Kanakas must not come without leave. The old lady herself,
however, kept sending to us for anything she happened to want,
and as the requests continually grew in magnitude the breaking-point
seemed only a question of time. One of the earlier demands,
to which Mr. Edmunds thought it advisable we should accede,
was for material for a flag for the new Republic; later, it floated
proudly as a tricolour, made of a piece of white cotton, some
red material from the photographic outfit, and a fragment of an
old blue shirt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elsewhere things went from bad to worse, and it seemed as
if the expected warship would never arrive. Word came that the
Kanakas had ordered the native overseer to leave his house, the
only one outside the village, and were taking away the servants
of the Manager; our photographer wrote that he “dared not
come over as their lives were being threatened”; and finally,
one afternoon we received a note from Mr. Edmunds, saying,
that “he could not leave the place as the Kanakas were talking
of coming up in a body to the house.” They were also, as we
later learnt, threatening to kill him if he resisted their taking
possession. It was obvious that the crisis had arrived; that we
must risk leaving the camp and go into Mataveri. We talked
over every conceivable plan of campaign, but it was too late to
do anything that night, and I remember that, finally at dinner,
to turn our thoughts, we discussed the curious manner in which
some of the statues had fallen. In four cases which we had
seen that day, while the body lay on its front, the head had
broken off in mid air, turned a complete somersault, and rested
on its back with the crown towards the neck. The next morning,
August 5th, I awoke early and recorded in my journal the events
of the day before. “Of course,” I added, “if it were a stage
play, just as the crisis arrived there would be cries of ‘the <em>Baquedano</em>
is here,’ and the curtain would fall. But, alas! it is not.”
Scarcely was the ink dry—only it was pencil—when a man rode up
waving a note from Mr. Edmunds, and shouting, “A ship!—a
ship!” The previous afternoon, as the Kanakas were assembling
in the village to go up to Mataveri, the <em>Baquedano</em> had been
sighted, and four of the ringleaders were now in irons. I scarcely
knew how great had been the long strain till the relief came.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Our rejoicings, however, we found to have been partly premature.
The warship had unfortunately brought with her large
gifts of clothes for the natives from well-wishers in Chile. Some
little while before attention had been drawn to the inhabitants
of Easter, by an Australian captain who had touched there on
his homeward voyage. The natives had, as usual, come off to
his ship in their oldest garments; he had been impressed with
their ragged condition and made a collection of clothes for them
in Australia amounting to many bales, but on his next voyage
to Chile he had been unable to touch again at the island and
had left them at Valparaiso. We had been asked to bring
these bales, but had declined on the score of space.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The
Chileans disliked the idea of their protectorate being indebted
to strangers, made a collection on their own account, and
despatched them by the <em>Baquedano</em>. It seemed unthinkable
that people, every one of whom for weeks had been consuming
stolen goods, and who, two days before, had been on the
verge of murder, should be immediately presented officially
with the commodity they most prized. I therefore went on
board the <em>Baquedano</em>, saw the Captain, and ventured to request
that the goods should be handed over to us, promising personally
to visit every house before our departure, ascertain the needs of
the people, and distribute the articles. “Surely,” he said, “you
shall have them.” Within a few hours they had been distributed
by his officers on the beach. Some of the garments were
useful, but an assortment of ball-slippers seemed a little out of
place, and the greater part of the community, men and women,
blossomed out into washing waistcoats. The stolen sheepskins,
or some of them, were returned, but three of the four ringleaders
were set at liberty, and no corporate punishment was inflicted;
indeed, the Captain had told me he considered that the natives
had “behaved very well not to murder Mr. Edmunds” prior to
our arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the ship left the island, the Captain wrote officially to
the “Head of the British Scientific Expedition” to the effect,
that the action he had been obliged to take to restore order
would probably have the result of rousing more feeling against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>foreigners; he therefore could not guarantee our safety and
offered us passages to Chile—an offer which, needless to say,
we declined. So ended the Revolution; we felt with interest
that the confidence of the Prophetess had been justified, at any
rate as far as 249 Kanakas were concerned out of the 250.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old lady died six months later; I attended her funeral.
The coffin was pathetically tiny, and neatly covered with black
and white calico. A service was first held in the church where,
during the rising, she used to take part in the assemblies and
address her adherents. There figured prominently in the
ceremony a model of the building and also two prie-dieu, roughly
made of boards, one of which she had used in private, the other
in public worship. She was laid to rest beneath the great
wooden cross, which marks the Kanaka burying-ground, between
the village and the bay. I stood at a little distance watching
gleams of sunshine on the great stones of the terrace of Hanga
Roa and on the grey sea beyond, and musing on the strange life
now closed, whose early days had been spent in a native hut
beneath the standing images of Raraku. My attention was
recalled by an evident hitch in the proceedings: difficulty had
arisen in lowering the coffin, owing to the fact that the prie-dieu
was also being fitted into the grave. When all had been finally
adjusted and the interment was completed, a sound was heard,
unusual in such circumstances—three English cheers—hip,
hip, hooray; the natives had learnt it from passing ships and
esteemed it an essential part of a ceremony. The company
was not large for the obsequies of one who had so recently been
the heroine of the village, and on asking in particular why a certain
near relative was absent, the answer received was that “there was
to be a great feast of pigs, and he was busy preparing it”; doubtless
others were similarly detained.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the remainder of our sojourn there were, as will be
seen, additional white men on the island. The Kanakas were
occupied in various ways and there was no further open demonstration,
but their independence and demands increased daily.
Since we left, a white employé of the Company has been murdered
by them and thrown into the sea.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><em>Mana</em> appeared on August 23rd, a week after the warship left,
and not before we had become a little anxious about her. She
had done the passage to the mainland in eighteen days, establishing
a record, but had had bad luck on her return journey,
the voyage having taken forty-one days. Even after her arrival
there was the usual chase to get hold of her, and we did not
receive the mail till late one night. We had had no letters
since we left Talcahuano the preceding February, and read them
eagerly during the small hours; it was the greatest relief to find
that at home all was well. The yacht had to put out again to
sea before the newspapers could be landed, but we later received
in them the accounts of the murder of the Austrian Archduke
and Duchess; even then, of course, Ireland and labour troubles
loomed much more largely on the political horizon. As soon as
the return mail was ready, on September 4th, we despatched
<em>Mana</em> again, the instructions sent home being that everything
was to be sent to Tahiti, as we expected to get off when she once
more returned the following November.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Baquedano</em> had brought some additions to the community
on the island: one or two Europeans to work on the estate and
a German to plant tobacco. The fact that the presence of this
last coincided with the declaration of the war, and the subsequent
use of the island by his nation as a naval base, gave rise later to
a good deal of comment; it is certain that but little effort was
made to grow tobacco. He left shortly before we did. A
schoolmaster from Chile was also among the new-comers; he was
sent by the Government, and brought an expensive school
building. In this he entertained us all to celebrate the day of
Chilean Independence, September 18th, when the natives gave
some masque dances, a fashion imported from Tahiti. It was
interesting to notice that the women always preferred to wear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>for best occasions their own distinctive dress, rather than the
smart clothes of the <em>Baquedano</em>, or similar gifts, which were
relegated to every-day service; I have seen a really beautifully
embroidered underskirt used for riding astride. The native garment
is of any washing material, preferably white for Sundays. It
falls straight and loosely down from a yoke, and is worn unreasonably
long; the sleeves are made to the wrist, with puffs at the
top (fig. 29). This fashion is said to be common throughout
the South Seas, presumably dating from the first introduction
of clothes by the missionaries.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>School was duly begun, but after a few days the children
ceased to appear, the master declared he was “not an attendance
officer,” and from then till we left, nearly a year later, no school
was held; the last we saw of the blackboard and counting-frame,
they were rotting in a field some two miles off, where they had
been taken by the French marooned sailors for use in some
carnival pony-races. The warship also brought an epidemic of
bad colds: every ship except <em>Mana</em> left some such legacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that peace was in some measure restored, we set to work
to excavate some of the statues which stood on the slope of the
Raraku mountain. The natives were entirely indifferent whether
they worked or not, but by paying high wages and giving any
quantity of mutton, we were able at this time to get a certain
amount of precarious labour for digging and camp work. The
whole lot, including my maid-servant, went in for every week-end
to the village, and it was always a matter of anxiety to know
whether they would ever return. Our Sundays were spent
peacefully, doing housework, taking the ponies to water in the
crater, changing their pitches at due intervals, and similar jobs.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had just begun the week’s work on Monday, October 12th,
when word was brought that some steamers had appeared. The
whole of the native staff, of course, at once departed to see what
could be begged from the ships. The vessels turned out to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>a German squadron, going, they said, “from the China station
to Valparaiso.” Some more turned up later, till there were twelve
in all, four or five of the number being warships, and the remainder
colliers or other smaller vessels. They kept entire silence on
the European situation. We had not, of course, the slightest
idea that war had broken out, still less that our lonely island
was the meeting-place, cleverly arranged by Admiral von Spee,
for his ships from Japan—the <em>Scharnhorst</em> and <em>Gneisenau</em>—with
the other German warships in this region; the <em>Nürnberg</em>
and <em>Leipzig</em> had turned up from the west coast of Mexico,
and the <em>Dresden</em> from the other side of South America. A
writer in the <em>Cornhill</em> (August 1917) states “there happened
to be upon it [Easter Island] a British scientific expedition, but
busied over the relics of the past, the single-minded men of
science did not take the trouble to cross the island to look at the
German ships.” S. was, as a matter of fact, twice over at
Mataveri while they were in Cook’s Bay, but it is true of this
“single-minded” woman, who felt she had something else to
do than to ride for some four hours to gaze at the outside of
German men-of-war. What did interest us was that presumably,
after the usual manner of passing ships, the officers would come
over to Raraku, and being intelligent Germans, would photograph
our excavations. We therefore turned to, and with our
own hands covered up our best things.</p>

<p class='c007'>We seized the opportunity to write letters, which were posted
on the ships, and one of our number went to see the doctor. To
the credit of the enemy be it said, that almost all the letters
subsequently arrived, a sad exception being a butterfly, addressed
to Professor Poulton at Oxford, which, if, as may have been the
case, it was retained as something valuable, presumably went
down off the Falkland Islands. Mr. Edmunds, meanwhile, had
not unnaturally rejoiced at having his market brought to his
door, and sold the ships nearly £1,000 worth of meat. They
offered to pay for it in gold, but it seemed common prudence
to ask instead for an order, a decision which was later sadly
lamented.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Thursday some of our staff returned: the Germans were,
it seemed, most unpopular; they did not come on shore and had
given no food, clothes, or soap. Kanaka sentiment at this
moment would have been certainly pro-Ally.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>On Friday rumours reached us that there was something
mysterious going on. Why, it was asked, did the Germans say
they had no newspapers, so rarely come on shore, and go out at
night without lights? and why did one officer say that “in two
months Germany would be at the top of the tree”? We
discussed the matter and passed it off as “bazaar talk.” On
Sunday, however, news came from Mataveri which we could
no longer wholly discredit. The German tobacco planter had
been on board, and the crew had disobeyed orders and disclosed
to their countryman the fact that there was a great European
war; the combatants were correctly stated, but much detail was
added. Two hundred thousand men were, it was said, waiting
at Kiel to invade England; the war had taken our country by
surprise, and the German ships had already made a sudden raid
and sunk eight or nine Dreadnoughts in the Thames; the Emperor
was nearly at Paris, though the French continued to fight
on most bravely. It was a terrible war as neither side would
show the white flag. An army had been sent from England to
the assistance of the French, but it had been badly defeated.
The English Labour Party had objected to troops being sent out
of the country, in consequence of which the Asquith ministry
had fallen, the House of Lords came in somehow; anyway,
England was now a Republic, and so were Canada and
Australia; India was in flames, and two troopships had been
sunk on the way there from Australia.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are still inclined to think that the Germans themselves
believed all these things; they had so often been told, by those
in authority, that such would occur on the outbreak of
war with England, that wishes had become facts. As a small
mercy we got the news of the loss of the German colonies, but
the <em>Scharnhorst</em>, which had just come from the French possession
of Tahiti, said that the natives there having risen and killed
the Germans, the warships had therefore bombarded the town
of Papeete, which was now “no more.” The reason given for
keeping us in the dark so long was, that hearing there were
foreigners on the island, they thought that we might fight
amongst ourselves. Von Spee made exact inquiries as to the
number of whites in the place, and told the Kanakas that when
he returned he would hold them responsible for our safety. The
real reason of the silence maintained was most probably to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>prevent any question being raised of their use of the island as a
naval base. When the news could no longer be concealed, the
officers gave it as their opinion, that “when Germany had
conquered France, peace would be made with England, in which
case Britain would probably gain some territory as she had such
good diplomatists,” a compliment at least for Lord Grey. The
reality of the war was brought home by the concrete fact that
the ships were reliably reported to be in fighting trim, with
no woodwork visible. That Sunday evening one of us saw the
squadron going round in the dusk, the flagship leading. They
had said that they would come again, but they never did. They
went on their way to Coronel and the Falklands.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday morning we met our photographer by arrangement
on the road to Mataveri, in order to take some of the half-way
terraces; he had brought two newspapers, which had at
last been got hold of, and we sat down beneath a wall to read
them. They were German ones, of September 15th and 17th,
published in Chile, and contained little news; but we read between
the lines that things were going better in France, for the Germans
had made “a strategic retreat according to plan,” and then the
curtain fell on the great drama. The ground rocked for us, as
it did at home in those first August days; it was just one week
since we had covered up our diggings and it seemed centuries.
How much to believe we did not know, but some of it sounded
plausible, and when later we found that England was facing the
struggle as a united whole, and that there was still a British
Empire, we felt that the greatest nightmare of the war had
passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the personal point of view our thoughts turned, of
course, to the yacht; she would no doubt remain in safety
at Talcahuano, that was a comfort. At any other time it would
have been a matter of anxiety that the crew should continue
indefinitely without employment, and that there was no pecuniary
arrangement there for so long a detention; as it was, we were so
absolutely helpless that the futility of worrying was obvious.
As regards ourselves, we could only cut down our use of such
things as flour and tea, and wait; our experience of war rations
thus came early. The most serious threatened shortage was
that of paper. It was intensely strange to go back to digging
out statues, when morning, noon, and night our hearts were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>over the seas; but that was “our job,” there was at least no
daily and hourly waiting for news, and in the peace of a plain
duty and the absolute silence of the sea around us there was a
certain kind of rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the next few weeks life went on quietly, sheep-shearing
absorbed the energies of the community, and the village was
laid low by an attack of dysentery, from which in a short time
there were eight deaths: the disease was either a legacy from
the Germans, or the result of the distribution of some more
<em>Baquedano</em> clothes which had been left with the schoolmaster.
It seemed as if we might spend the rest of our lives on the island,
when suddenly, as things always happened in mid-Pacific, on
December 1st, six weeks after the departure of the German
squadron, a little ship turned up. She was flying the Chilean
flag, but had an English captain, and was to take back word to
Valparaiso how things were going on the island. She brought good
news on the whole, but also the regretted tidings of the sinking
of the <em>Good Hope</em> and <em>Monmouth</em> on November 1st. Mr. Gillam
wrote that the yacht was, as we had expected, detained at
Talcahuano till the passage was considered safe. The point
which immediately concerned us was the offer of passages in this
vessel to Chile should we desire them; but she could only by her
charter stay some five days, during which time it would have
been quite impossible, even had our work been finished, to
transport our goods from Raraku. There was no room for
hesitation: S. must go and look after <em>Mana</em>, and insure her
against war risks. Mr. Ritchie and the Fernandez boy had
already sailed on the <em>Baquedano</em>, and as the photographer’s work
on the island was nearly done for the present, it seemed best he
should accompany my husband and resume his post on the
yacht. Bailey and I were therefore left to represent the Expedition
on the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the good-byes had been said, it was better not to have
time to think, so we at once set to work, packed up such things
as were necessary from our country house, and transferred the
camp back to Mataveri. There I took up life once more in my
tent by the grave of the murdered manager. Mr. Edmunds
would, I knew, kindly give me assistance in case of necessity,
and it was desirable to be near the village, for I proposed to spend
the time till S. returned in interviews with such of the old people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>as could remember traditions and customs, prior to the coming
of Christianity. This work was, however, not destined to
continue undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Wednesday morning, December 23rd, another German
ship came into Cook’s Bay—the armed cruiser <em>Prinz Eitel
Friedrich</em>. The Manager went on board, and returned with the
information that the Captain had said he “would require thirty
or forty beasts, but that as the crew would be busy next day
they would not take them till after Christmas.” They would
give no account of themselves, nor any news of the war. It was
a relief to realize that S. would not yet have had time to leave
Chile, and that he and the yacht were presumably safe in harbour.
That very afternoon, however, my writing was interrupted by
a cry of congratulation from the native girls at work in Mr.
Edmunds’ kitchen, “<em>Mana</em> is coming.” A woman, who had
been up on the high ground, had reported that she had seen the
little vessel off the south coast and that she was now sailing
round Rano Kao, hence making direct for Cook’s Bay. It
might, of course, be a mistake, but it was, on the other hand,
just possible that Mr. Gillam had seized an opportunity to slip
across to the island without waiting for a reply to his letter.
The immediate question, supposing that it was indeed <em>Mana</em>,
was how she could be stopped walking straight into the jaws of
the enemy. Bailey saddled in haste, and rode up to the top of
the headland to try to warn her not to proceed. I armed myself
with a towel and coat to make a two-flag signal, which denotes
urgency, and fled down to the rocks on the coast below, selecting
a point from which it was possible to command the furthest
view, without being noticed from the cruiser. It was a very
forlorn hope, that it might be possible to attract the yacht’s
attention before she was seen by the enemy, but it was obviously
out of the question to continue, under a tree, copying notes
while <em>Mana</em> might be at the moment meeting with a watery
grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>My thoughts, while I sat there with eyes glued to the horizon,
went back to academic discussions with Admiral Fremantle
on board a P. &#38; O. liner only a few years before, on the right
in war-time to capture private property at sea, and how
little it had then occurred to me that the matter would ever
become so vitally personal. I waited for two and a half hours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>not daring to leave, but with hope growing momentarily stronger
that there was an error somewhere. Meanwhile, Bailey had
seen the vessel from the mountain and was confident that it was
the returning yacht, but had been unable to get into touch with
her. He had come down and consulted with Mr. Edmunds,
who had then most kindly ridden over to the south coast to see
what could be done from there; the nearer view had made clear
that the alarm was a false one, the vessel was not <em>Mana</em> but some
other passing schooner, and we breathed once more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everyone, however, seemed to take particular pleasure in
talking to the Germans about the yacht and her movements, in
a way which to me was more amusing than reassuring. As a
scientific ship, she theoretically shared with Red Cross vessels
immunity under the Hague Convention, but even in those days,
as will have been seen, that did not bring complete confidence.
One of the German officers had, I was told, given it as his opinion
that his Captain would not touch her, but “it was,” he remarked,
“a matter for individual judgment, and other commanders
might act differently.” The same officer expressed his surprise
that the Manager had ventured on the cruiser, as he “might have
been made a prisoner, as a German had been on a French ship”;
whereupon Mr. Edmunds naturally resolved not to accept an
informal invitation to attend theatricals to be held on board
on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reason for the occupation of the crew soon became obvious.
The warship went out on the following morning and returned with
a French barque, the <em>Jean</em>, which she had captured some time
before, and which, being laden with coal, she had towed most
of the way to the island. She laid the barque alongside her
in Cook’s Bay and proceeded to hoist out the cargo (fig. 24),
finally shooting away the masts and spars in order that the French
ship might not capsize as she gradually lost her ballast.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cruiser, it transpired, had also on board it the crew
of an English sailing ship, the <em>Kildalton</em>, which she had captured
and sunk near the Horn; but when an attempt was made to
speak to the men, they were ordered below. The German officers
and crew then landed daily, rode over the island, came up to the
Manager’s house, and generally behaved as if the whole place
belonged to them. The officers were courteous and always
saluted when we met, an attention with which one would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>preferred to dispense; one of the crew penetrated to our kitchen,
which he was at once requested to leave, in spite of Bailey’s
evident fear that he and I would immediately be ordered out for
execution; the man hesitated, looked astonished, but obeyed.
It must be remembered that there was no reason to suppose
that it was otherwise than civilised warfare, the idea that anyone
could or would injure non-combatants on neutral soil never
seriously occurred to me: the story of Belgium was unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Indignation was, however, roused by the fact that the Germans
were remaining far beyond the twenty-four hours to which they
were entitled in a neutral port, and obviously again using the
island as a base. It grew to fever-heat when news came that a
signal-station had been erected on Rano Aroi, the high central
point, with an officer and men in charge, from which notice
might be given to the cruiser below if an “enemy” ship was
sighted. I took Juan, the headman of the village who was our
usual escort, rode up to the point in question, and thus verified
the fact of the station and men on watch. I remained at a short
distance, but Juan went on and spoke to the Germans; he
came back to me saying impressively, “They do not like to see
you here,” to which sentiment the reply naturally was “I
dislike still more to see them.” Never would the white ensign
have been more welcome! To relieve my feelings, although
with a sense of futility, I wrote a formal protest, under the
grandiloquent title of “Acting Head of the British Scientific
Expedition,” pointing out for the benefit of the Chilean Government
these abuses of neutrality. The schoolmaster had been,
since his arrival, the formal representative of his country, and
I went down to the village to give it to him; its presentation
was delayed by his having gone on board the cruiser, for the
Christmas theatricals, where he remained over the next day, but
it was finally handed to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>On New Year’s Eve I was coming in from a business ride about
1 o’clock, and, having breakfasted at 6, was feeling not a
little hungry, when the German ship was seen steaming from
her anchorage, looking as she did so like a great blot on the
radiant sea. The first impression was that she was leaving the
island, but on observing more closely, her errand was apparent;
she was not alone, but had the graceful little barque with her,
towing her side by side in a last Judas embrace. Naturally, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>could go no farther, and for two and a half hours a little company,
including the crew of the doomed ship, who had just been landed,
sat spell-bound on the cliff watching the tragedy. When the
cruiser had gone a short distance, but well within the three-mile
limit, she cast the French vessel adrift, the small craft rolled
helplessly, high out of the water, without ballast or cargo, and
with only a mizzen-mast remaining. The warship then swooped
round in great circles like an evil bird of prey, and every time
that she came broadside on she fired at her victim. The first
shot missed; the second went through the upper part of the
barque into the sea the other side. The third shot obviously
told, but the executioner fired once again and then ceased,
satisfied with her work, for the little ship could be seen gradually
regaining her water-line, though with an ominous list, and a
ballast never designed by the builder. As she sank she drifted
slowly southward, at the mercy of wind and current. The
cruiser moved with her, keeping at an even distance and
steadily watching her victim till suddenly the end came, and
where there had been two vessels on the blue sea only one
remained. Another gallant ship had joined the company of
ghosts in the ocean Hades below.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she had thus accomplished her work, the <em>Eitel Friedrich</em>
departed, having taken on board stores, which would, she stated,
with those already in hand, last her till the following April. She
kept her prisoners on board till almost the last, in order to serve,
it was said, as hostages should a British warship appear, and
then deposited them all on shore. Our feelings on thus finding
our island invaded, resembled, in some measure, the classical
ones of Robinson Crusoe on a somewhat similar occasion; the
new-comers consisted of the captains and crews of both the
English and French ships, forty-eight persons in all. They had
been well treated on the cruiser, and were given on landing the
remaining stores out of the sunken barque. A camp was made
for them in the wool-shed, near the landing-place at Hanga Piko,
and formed a great attraction to the natives who flocked there
hourly to see what could be picked up. A room was found for
the captain of the English ship in the Manager’s house, where
he made a pleasant addition to the party. The charms of Easter
Island did not appeal to him, and he was naturally concerned for
the anxiety which would be felt at home when his ship was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>reported “missing.” His great occupation was to walk, many
times a day, to the top of the knoll behind my tent, to try to
catch sight of a sail, a hope which those of us who were better
acquainted with the island felt to be somewhat forlorn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately, the epidemic of dysentery which had prevailed
in the island since the previous October, laid low some of the
sailors. This was a serious anxiety, as there was no doctor of
any kind, and the only medical stores and books were those of
the Expedition, which had to be routed out from our camp at
the other end of the island. One young Englishman, named
Campbell, to our great regret, succumbed to the disease; he
was “the only son of his mother, and she was a widow”; a
little white cross in the Easter Island burial-ground makes yet
another memorial of the Great War. Captain Sharp’s persistent
look-out was rewarded sooner than might have been expected;
false hopes were raised by a vessel which went on without waiting,
but when the marooned men had been with us some two months,
a Swedish steamer appeared. She had come out of her way
attracted by the fame of the antiquities, and it was a pleasure
to show one or two of the officers what little could be seen of
those statues near Cook’s Bay. She kindly took on board the
English crew and the greater part of the Frenchmen, but a few
of the latter preferred to remain, on the ground that they had
“sent word to the French Consul at Valparaiso, and must await
his directions.” It was said that, prior to leaving the <em>Eitel
Friedrich</em>, they had signed an undertaking never to bear arms
against Germany, and they were consequently not anxious to
find themselves again in France, where their position might
be invidious. One of them, who hailed from the French West
Indies, subsequently married his hostess, a lady in the village.
The wedding was celebrated in the church and largely attended;
during a great part of the service the couple sat on a low form
before the altar, with the arm of the bridegroom round the waist
of the bride; the ceremony was followed by a sumptuous and
decorous repast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such an excitement as the German visit had of course upset
my grown-up children, but we gradually resumed our talks.
The ways, means, and result of those conversations will come
more appropriately under the heading of the scientific work.
It took, as a rule, about the same number of hours to copy out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the rough notes of an interview as to get the substance; if,
therefore, the morning had been given to talk, the afternoon
was spent in writing. It soon became obvious that it was going
to be a race against time to get all the information available
before <em>Mana</em> returned, especially as the interviews involved a
certain amount of strain, and it was better, in the interests of
all, to diversify them with topographical and other work. In
this sense every day was prized which the yacht delayed her
return, and there was little opportunity for feeling lonely, at
any rate during working hours. The time, however, began to
grow long. January changed into February, and February
turned into March, and there was still no news of her; everyone
began to inquire if I were “not becoming very anxious,” in a
manner which was truly reassuring. And now, in approved
fashion, we will turn and see what was happening to the other
part of the Expedition.</p>

<p class='c007'>After leaving the Raraku camp S. had ridden in to Cook’s
Bay, and there had difficulties about getting on board, for the
Kanakas had made one bargain for the use of their boat, and
then wanted double; during the delay rain came on, and he
was obliged to shelter himself and his goods in the native boathouse
by the landing. He at length, however, reached the ship,
where the captain gave him his own cabin under the bridge. At
tea-time the first officer, who was of German nationality, came
out of his cabin and conversed in such a way that it was obvious
that he was not altogether sober; the captain soon came along,
rated him for drinking, told him the curse of the sea was alcohol,
and he was to go at once on deck. Upon which the mate ascended
to the bridge, groaning deeply. Now the said captain
had, unfortunately, on board sixteen cases of whisky, which he
had brought to trade at Easter, but which Mr. Edmunds had not
allowed him to land. He himself shortly began to drink steadily,
and went on till delirium tremens supervened, and he became
obsessed with the idea that there was an affray going on between
the sailors and stewards. By the arrangement of the vessel, the
crew were berthed for’ard and the stewards aft, while the waist
of the ship was filled by a stack of coal, which had been left on
deck, to save the trouble of stowing it in the bunkers, and in the
pious hope that no bad weather would supervene. On the top
of this coal the captain now took his stand, declared that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>he would have no fighting on his ship, and hurled pieces of coal
first at an imaginary crew for’ard and then at supposititious
stewards aft; though all hands were in reality carefully lying
low to keep out of his way.</p>

<p class='c007'>S., meanwhile, was unfortunately confined to his cabin,
having gone down, about the second day out, with a very severe
attack of dysentery; the epidemic on the island had never
reached our camp; he had presumably contracted it during
the delay in starting. His position was anything but enviable:
there was no steward, only a cabin-boy, well-meaning, but
languid and very dirty. He could get no food which he could take,
and lay there helpless with the rats eating his clothes; if it had
not been for the kindness of the chief engineer, who looked in
occasionally, it seems doubtful if he would have lived to reach
Chile. To this pleasing state was now added the apprehension
that the captain, who was wandering about by day and night,
might at any moment attack him for being in the cabin, in anticipation
of which event S. kept a loaded revolver under his pillow.
At last things got to such a state that the chief engineer came
and asked his advice on the desirability of screwing up the
skipper, Oxford fashion, and passing his food through the port.
Before, however, this step could be taken, the offender had
reached the stage of mental collapse, melted into tears and spent
his time in protracted prayers, beseeching the engineer to put
the accursed stuff overboard. S. naturally advised taking him
at his word, when it was found that he had been drinking at the
rate of nearly three bottles a day.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this time the German mate had been obliged, to his great
annoyance, to keep sober for the sake of his own safety, but as
they approached Juan Fernandez there was much anxiety on
board, for no one was very sure where it was, and they wanted
to see it without hitting it; by good luck it was fortunately
sighted during the hours of daylight. They managed, somehow,
to reach Valparaiso, and S. was at once taken to the same English
hospital to which Mr. Corry had been removed. Here he lay for
weeks, delighted to be well nursed and comfortable, and when
convalescent, was most hospitably entertained by our friend
Mr. Hope-Simpson, till he was equal to going down to Talcahuano
to see after the yacht.</p>

<p class='c007'>On February 20th, 1915, <em>Mana</em>, now duly insured, sallied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>forth once more, having lain at Talcahuano for nearly five
months. Von Spee’s squadron had been annihilated off the
Falkland Islands on December 8th, and though the exact whereabouts
of his sole remaining ship, the <em>Dresden</em>, were still unknown,
the coast was thought to be clear. As a matter of fact, the
cruiser had crept out of her hiding-place in the Patagonian
Channels sixteen days earlier, and was at this time not far from
the entrance to the bay, where she was no doubt apprised by
wireless from the shore of the movements of all shipping. Luckily
the yacht’s departure was delayed at the last by some parting
arrangements, and she left port some hours later than had been
intended; in the interval, according to information subsequently
received, another ship went by, the cruiser captured her and
went off. Thus did <em>Mana</em> pass by in safety, and before she
reached Easter Island the <em>Dresden</em> had met with her doom at
Juan Fernandez.</p>

<p class='c007'>March 15th was a joyful day, when the yacht at length turned
up all safe and sound. We rapidly decided that the best thing
we could do would be to let the British Representative in Chile
know at once of the call of the <em>Eitel Friedrich</em>, and of the use
made of the island by the Germans, more particularly as there
were recent reports from more than one quarter that a vessel
with two funnels had been seen off the island. A despatch was
therefore written for our Minister at Santiago, and Mr. Gillam
was instructed to hand it with a covering letter to the British
Consul at Valparaiso. The enemy might turn up any day, and,
in view of the gossip there had been about the yacht when they
were here before, it was obviously desirable to maintain secrecy
as to her whereabouts. No one save the Sailing-master, therefore,
was informed of her destination; she lay for two nights off
Hanga Roa, and on the third morning she was gone. On her
arrival at Valparaiso the Consul requested Mr. Gillam to take the
despatch himself to Santiago in order to answer any questions
in his power; this he did, and had a long interview with the
British Minister. We have subsequently received kind acknowledgment
from the Admiralty of our efforts to be useful. The
yacht then returned to the island,<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> where we had been doing
last things, including finishing off our excavations, in which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>were very kindly assisted by some of the remaining members of
the French crew; they worked for us at a rate of pay refused
by the natives. The packing-up of specimens alone was no light
business. There had turned out to be much more work to be
done on the island than we had anticipated, and though our
residence had been prolonged far beyond the time originally
contemplated, we had, from the scientific point of view, been
largely single-handed and had also been hindered by circumstances.
So far as research was concerned we would gladly
have remained for another six months, to write up results
and make good omissions; but England was at war, the three
years our crew had signed on for would shortly expire, our
wonderful time was over, and we must go.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many places it is possible in the light of great monuments
to reconstruct the past. In Easter Island the past is the present,
it is impossible to escape from it; the inhabitants of to-day are
less real than the men who have gone; the shadows of the
departed builders still possess the land. Voluntarily or involuntarily
the sojourner must hold commune with those old workers;
for the whole air vibrates with a vast purpose and energy which
has been and is no more. What was it? Why was it? The
great works are now in ruins, of many comparatively little
remains; but the impression infinitely exceeded anything which
had been anticipated, and every day, as the power to see increased,
brought with it a greater sense of wonder and marvel.
“If we were to tell people at home these things,” said our Sailing-master,
after being shown the prostrate images on the great
burial-place of Tongariki, “they would not believe us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The present natives take little interest in the remains. The
statues are to them facts of every-day life in much the same
way as stones or banana-trees. “Have you no <em>moai</em>” (as they
are termed) “in England?” was asked by one boy, in a tone
in which surprise was slightly mingled with contempt; to ask
for the history of the great works is as successful as to try to
get from an old woman selling bootlaces at Westminster the
story of Cromwell or of the frock-coated worthies in Parliament
Square. The information given in reply to questions is generally
wildly mythical, and any real knowledge crops up only indirectly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Anyone who is able to go to the British Museum can see a
typical specimen of an Easter Island statue, in the large image
which greets the approaching visitor from under the portico
(fig. 31). The general form is unvarying, and with one exception,
which will be alluded to hereafter, all appear to be the work of
skilled hands, which suggests that the design was well known
and evolved under other conditions. It represents a half-length
figure, at the bottom of which the hands nearly meet in front
of the body. The most remarkable features are the ears, of
which the lobe is depicted to represent a fleshy rope (fig. 58),
while in a few cases the disc which was worn in it is also indicated
(fig. 59). The fashion of piercing and distending the lobe
of the ear is found among various primitive races.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The tallest
statues are over 30 feet, a few are only 6 feet, and even smaller
specimens exist. Those which stood on the burial-places, now
to be described, are usually from 12 to 20 feet in height, and were
surmounted with a form of hat.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><em>Position and Number of Ahu.</em>—In Easter Island the problem
of the disposal of the dead was solved by neither earth-burial
nor cremation, but by means of the omnipresent stones which
were built up to make a last resting-place for the departed.
Such burial-places are known as “ahu,” and the name will
henceforth be used, for it signifies a definite thing, or rather
type of thing, for which we have no equivalent. They number
in all some two hundred and sixty, and are principally found
near the coast, but some thirty exist inland, sufficient to show
that their erection on the seaboard was a matter of convenience,
not of principle. With the exception of the great eastern and
western headlands, where they are scarce, it is probably safe to
say that, in riding round the island, it is impossible to go anywhere
for more than a few hundred yards without coming across
one of these abodes of the dead. They cluster most thickly on
the little coves and their enclosing promontories, which were the
principal centres of population. Some are two or three hundred
yards away from the edge of the cliff, others stand on the
verge; in the lower land they are but little above the sea-level,
while on the precipitous part of the coast the ocean breaks
hundreds of feet below.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>It was these burial-places, on which the images were then
standing, which so strongly impressed the early voyagers and
whose age and origin have remained an unsolved problem.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the whole of our time on the island we worked on
the ahu as way opened. Those which happened to lie near
to either of our camps were naturally easy of access, but to
reach the more distant ones, notably those on the north shore,
involved a long expedition. Such a day began with perhaps an
hour’s ride; at noon there was an interval for luncheon, when,
in hot weather, the neighbourhood was scoured for miles to find
the smallest atom of shade; and the day ended with a journey
home of not less than two hours, during which an anxious eye
was kept on the sinking sun. The usual method, as each ahu
was reached, was for S. to dismount, measure it and describe it,
while I sat on my pony and scribbled down notes; but in some
manner or other every part of the coast was by one or both of
us ridden over several times, and a written statement made of
the size, kind, condition, and name of each monument.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately there is in existence no large-scale plan of the
coast, a need we had to supply as best we could; map of Easter
Island there is none, only the crude chart; the efforts of our
own surveyor were limited, by the time at his disposal, to making
detailed plans of a few of the principal spots. The want is to be
regretted geographically, but it does not materially affect the
archæological result. We were always accompanied by native
guides in order to learn local names and traditions, and it was
soon found necessary to make a point of these being old men;
owing to the concentration of the remains of the population in
one district, all names elsewhere, except those of the most important
places, are speedily being forgotten. The memories of
even the older men were sometimes shaky, and to get reasonably
complete and accurate information the whole of a district had,
in more than one case, to be gone over again with a second ancient
who turned out to have lived in the neighbourhood in his youth
and hence to be a better authority.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Original Design and Construction of Image Ahu.</em>—The burial-places
are not all of one type, nor all constructed to carry statues;
some also are known to have been built comparatively recently,
and will therefore be described under a later section. The
image ahu are, however, all prehistoric. They number just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>under a hundred, or over one-third of the whole.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a> The figures
connected with them, of which traces still remain, were counted
as 231, but as many are in fragments, this number is uncertain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Atypical image ahu (fig. 36) is composed of a long wall running
parallel with the sea, which, in a large specimen, is as much as
15 feet in height and 300 feet in length; it is buttressed on the
land side with a great slope of masonry. The wall is in three
divisions. The main or central portion projects in the form
of a terrace on which the images stood, with their backs to the
sea; it is therefore broad enough to carry their oval bed-plates;
these measure up to about 10 feet in length by 8 feet or 9 feet
in width, and are flush with the top of the wall. On the great
ahu of Tongariki there have been fifteen statues, but sometimes
an ahu has carried one figure only.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wall which forms the landward side of the terrace is
continued on either hand in a straight line, thus adding a
wing at each end of the central portion which stands somewhat
farther back from the sea (fig. 41). Images were sometimes
placed on the wings, but it was not usual. From this continuous
wall the masonry slopes steeply till it reaches a containing wall,
some 3 feet high, formed of finely wrought slabs of great
size and of peculiar shape; the workmanship put into this wall
is usually the most highly finished of any part of the ahu. Extending
inland from the foot of this low wall is a large, raised,
and smoothly paved expanse. The upper surface of this, too,
has an appreciable fall, or slope, inland, though it is almost
horizontal, when compared with the glacis.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the method of construction of this area, vault accommodation
is obtained between its surface pavement and the sheet of
volcanic rock below, on which the whole rests. In the largest
specimen the whole slope of masonry, measured that is from
either the sea-wall of the wing or from the landward wall of the
terrace to its farthest extent, is about 250 feet. Beyond this
the ground is sometimes levelled for another 50 or 60 yards,
forming a smooth sward which much enhanced the appearance
of the ahu. In two cases the ahu is approached by a strip of
narrow pavement formed of water-worn boulders laid flat, and
bordered with the same kind of stone set on end; one of these
pavements is 220 feet in length by 12 feet in width, the other
is somewhat smaller (fig. 93).</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>FIG. 36.—DIAGRAM OF IMAGE AHU.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The general principle on which the sea or main walls are
constructed is usually the same, though the various ahu differ
greatly in appearance: first comes a row of foundation blocks
on which have been set upright the largest stones that could be
found; the upper part of the wall is composed of smaller stones,
and it is finished with a coping. The variety in effect is due to
the difference in material used. In some cases, as at Tongariki
(fig. 33), the most convenient stone available has consisted of
basalt which has cooled in fairly regular cubes, and the rows are
there comparatively uniform in size; in other instances, as at
Ahu Tepeu on the west coast (fig. 37), the handiest material
has been sheets of lava, which have hardened as strata, and
when these have been used the first tier of the wall is composed
of huge slabs up to 9 feet in height. Irregularities in the
shape and size of the big stones are rectified by fitting in small
pieces and surmounting the shorter slabs with additional stones
until the whole is brought to a uniform level; on the top of this
now even tier horizontal blocks are laid, till the whole is the
desired height (fig. 42). The amount of finish put into the work
varies greatly: in many ahu the walls are all constructed of
rough material; in others, while the slabs are untouched, the
stones which bring them to the level and the cubes on the top
are well wrought; in a very few instances, of which Vinapu
(fig. 35) is the best example, the whole is composed of beautifully
finished work. Occasionally, as at Oroi, natural outcrops of
rock have been adapted to carry statues (fig. 122).</p>

<p><span class='right'>FIG. 38.</span><br><br>METHOD OF EXPOSING THE DEAD FROM ILLUSTRATED DESCRIPTIONS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>The study of the ahu is simplified by the fact that they were
being used in living memory for the purpose for which they
were doubtless originally built. They have been termed “burial-places,”
but burial in its usual sense was not the only, nor in
most cases their principal, object. On death the corpse was
wrapped in a tapa blanket and enclosed in its mattress of
reeds; fish-hooks, chisels, and other objects were sometimes
included. It was then bound into a bundle and carried on staves
to the ahu, where it was exposed on an oblong framework. This
consisted of four corner uprights set up in the ground, the upper
extremities of which were Y-shaped, two transverse bars rested
in the bifurcated ends, one at the head, the other at the foot, and
on these transverse bars were placed the extremities of the
bundle which wrapped the corpse. The description and sketch
are based on a model framework, and a wrapped-up figure, one
of the wooden images of the island, prepared by the natives to
amplify their verbal description.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a> At times, instead of the four
supports, two stones were used with a hole in each, into which a
Y-shaped stick was placed (fig. 38). While the corpse remained
on the ahu the district was marked off by the péra, or taboo, for
the dead; no fishing was allowed near, and fires and cooking
were forbidden within certain marks—the smoke, at any rate,
must be hidden or smothered with grass. Watch was kept by
four relatives, and anyone breaking the regulations was liable
to be brained. The mourning might last one, two, or even
three years, by which time the whole thing had, of course, fallen
to pieces. The bones were either left on the ahu, or collected
and put into vaults of oblong shape, which were kept for the
family, or they might be buried elsewhere. The end of the
mourning was celebrated by a great feast, after which ceremony,
as one recorder cheerfully concluded, “Pappa was finished.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Looked at from the landward side, we may, therefore, conceive
an ahu as a vast theatre stage, of which the floor runs gradually
upwards from the footlights. The back of the stage, which is
thus the highest part, is occupied by a great terrace, on which
are set up in line the giant images, each one well separated from
his neighbour, and all facing the spectator. Irrespective of
where he stands he will ever see them towering above him,
clear cut out against a turquoise sky. In front of them are the
remains of the departed. Unseen, on the farther side of the
terrace, is the sea. The stone giants, and the faithful dead over
whom they watch, are never without music, as countless
waves launch their strength against the pebbled shore, showering
on the figures a cloud of mist and spray.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Reconstruction and Transformation.</em>—Those which have been
described are ideal image ahu, but not one now remains in its
original condition. It is by no means unusual to find, even in
the oldest parts now existing, that is in walls erected to carry
statues, pieces of still older images built into the stonework; in
one case a whole statue has been used as a slab for the sea-wall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>showing that alteration has taken place even when the cult was
alive (fig. 42). Again, a considerable number of ahu, some
thirteen in all, after being destroyed and terminating their
career as image-terraces, have been rebuilt after the fashion of
others constructed originally on a different plan (fig. 39). This
is a type for which no name was found: it is in form that of a
semi-pyramid, and there are between fifty and sixty on the
island, in addition to those which have been in the first place
image ahu (fig. 42). A few are comparatively well made, but
most are very rough. They resemble a pyramid cut in two, so
that the section forms a triangle; this triangle is the sea-wall;
the flanking buttress on the land side is made of stones, and is
widest at the apex or highest point, gradually diminishing to
the angles or extremities. The greatest height, in the centre,
varies from about 5 feet to 12 feet, and a large specimen may
extend in length from 100 feet to 160 feet. They contain vaults.
In a few instances they are ornamented by broken pieces of
image-stone, and occasionally by a row of small cairns along
the top, which recall the position of the statues on the image-platform;
for these no very certain reason was forthcoming, they
were varyingly reported to be signs of “péra” or as marking
the respective right of families on the ahu. As image-terraces
may be found reconstructed as pyramid ahu, the latter form
of building must have been carried on longer than the former,
and probably till recent times, but there is nothing to show
whether or not the earliest specimens of pyramid ahu are contemporary
with the great works, or even earlier.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Overthrow of the Images and Destruction of the Ahu.</em>—The only
piece of a statue which still remains on its bed-plate is the fragment
already alluded to at Tongariki (fig. 34). In the best-preserved
specimens the figures lie on their faces like a row of
huge nine-pins; some are intact, but many are broken, the
cleavage having generally occurred when the falling image has
come in contact with the containing wall at the lower level.
The curious way in which the heads have not infrequently
turned a somersault while falling and now lie face uppermost
is shown in the eighth figure from the western end on Tongariki
ahu (fig. 34).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>No one now living remembers a statue standing on an ahu;
and legend, though not of a very impressive character, has
already arisen to account for the fall of some of them. An old
man arrived, it is said, in the neighbourhood of Tongariki, and
as he was unable to speak, he made known by means of signs
that he wished for chicken-heads to eat; these were not forthcoming.
He slept, however, in one of the houses there, and
during the night his hosts were aroused by a great noise, which
he gave it to be understood was made by his feet tapping against
the stone foundations of the house. In the morning it was
found that the statues on the great ahu had all fallen: it was
the revenge of the old man. Such lore is, however, mixed up
with more tangible statements to the effect that the figures were
overthrown in tribal warfare by means of a rope, or by taking
away the small stones from underneath the bed-plates, and thus
causing them to fall forward. That the latter method had been
used had been concluded independently by studying the remains
themselves. It will be seen later, that other statues which
have been set up in earth were deliberately dug out, and it
seems unnecessary to look, as some have done, to an earthquake
to account for their collapse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, the conclusion that the images owed their fall to
deliberate vandalism during internecine warfare is confirmed by
knowledge, which still survives, connected with the destruction
of the last one. This image stood alone on an ahu on the north
coast, called Paro, and is the tallest known to have been put up
on a terrace, being 32 feet in height. The events occurred just
before living memory, and, like most stories in Easter Island,
it is connected with cannibalism. A woman of the western
clans was eaten by men of the eastern; her son managed to
trap thirty of the enemy in a cave and consumed them in revenge;
and during the ensuing struggle this image was thrown down
(fig. 78). The oldest man living when we were on the island said
that he was an infant at the time; and another, a few years
younger, stated that his father as a boy helped his grandfather
in the fight. It is not, after all, only in Easter Island that
pleasure has been taken during war-time in destroying the
architectural treasures of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>While, therefore, the date of the erection of the earliest image
ahu is lost in the mists of antiquity, nor are we yet in a position
to say when the building stopped, we can give approximately
the time of the overthrow of the images. We know,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>from the accounts of the early voyagers, that the statues, or the
greater number of them, were still in place in the eighteenth
century; by the early part of the middle of the nineteenth century
not one was standing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The destruction of the ahu has continued in more modern
days. A manager, whose sheep had found the fresh-water
springs below high water, thinking they were injuring themselves
by drinking from the sea, erected a wall round a large part of
the coast to keep them from it. For this wall the ahu came in
of course most conveniently; it was run through a great number
and their material used for its construction. One wing of
Tongariki has been pulled down to form an enclosure for the
livestock. In addition to the damage wrought by man, the
ocean is ever encroaching: in some cases part of an ahu has
already fallen into the sea, and more is preparing to follow;
statues may be found lying on their backs in process of
descending into the waves (fig. 43). One row of images, on the
extreme western edge of the crater of Rano Kao, which were
visible, although inaccessible, at the time of the visit of the U.S.A.
ship <em>Mohican</em> in 1886, are now lying on the shore a thousand
feet below. As the result of these various causes the burial-places
of Easter Island are, as has been seen, all in ruins, and
many are scarcely recognisable; only their huge stones and
prostrate figures show what they must once have been.</p>

    <div>Rano Raraku, its Quarries and Standing Statues—the South-east Face of the Mountain—Isolated Statues—Roads—Stone Crowns of the Images.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Strange as it may appear, it is by no means easy to obtain a
complete view of a statue on the island: most of the images
which were formerly on the ahu lie on their faces, many are
broken, and detail has largely been destroyed by weather.
Happily, we are not dependent for our knowledge of the images
on such information as we can gather from the ruins on the ahu,
but are able to trace them to their origin, though even here
excavation is necessary to see the entire figure. Rano Raraku
is, as has already been explained, a volcanic cone containing a
crater lake. It resembles, to use an unromantic simile, one of the
china drinking-vessels dedicated to the use of dogs, whose base is
larger than their brim. Its sides are for the most part smooth and
sloping, and several carriages could drive abreast on the northern
rim of the crater, but towards the south-east it rises in height,
and from this aspect it looks as if the circular mass had been
sliced down with a giant knife forming it into a precipitous cliff.
The cliff is lowest where the imaginary knife has come nearest
to the central lake, thus causing the two ends to stand out as
the peaks already mentioned (fig. 45).</p>

<p class='c007'>The mountain is composed of compressed volcanic ash,
which has been found in certain places to be particularly
suitable for quarrying; it has been worked on the southern
exterior slope, and also inside the crater both on the south and
south-eastern sides. With perhaps a dozen exceptions, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>whole of the images in the island have been made from it, and
they have been dragged from this point up hill and down dale
to adorn the terraces round the coast-line of the island; even
the images on the ahu, which have fallen into the sea on the
further extremity of the western volcano, are said to have been
of the same stone. It is conspicuous in being a reddish brown
colour, of which the smallest chips can be easily recognised. It
is composite in character, and embedded in the ash are numerous
lapilli of metamorphic rock. Owing to the nature of this rock
the earliest European visitors came to the conclusion that the
material was factitious and that the statues were built of clay
and stones; it was curious to find that the marooned prisoners
of war of our own time fell into the same mistake of thinking that
the figures were “made up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The workable belt, generally speaking, forms a horizontal
section about half-way up the side of the mountain. Below
it, both on the exterior and within the crater, are banks of
detritus, and on these statues have been set up; most of them
are still in place, but they have been buried in greater or less
degree by the descent of earth from above (fig. 57). Mr. Ritchie
made a survey of the mountain with the adjacent coast, but it
was found impossible to record the results of our work without
some sort of plan or diagram which was large enough to show
every individual image. This was accomplished by first studying
each quarry, note-book in hand, and then, with the aid of field
glasses, amalgamating the results from below; the standing
statues being inserted in their relation to the quarries above.
It was a lengthy but enjoyable undertaking. Part of the diagram
of the exterior has been redrawn with the help of photographs
(fig. 60); the plan of the inside of the crater is shown
in what is practically its original form (fig. 47).</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Quarries of Rano Raraku.</em>—Leaving on one side for the moment
the figures on the lower slope, let us in imagination scramble up
the grassy side, a steep climb of some one or two hundred feet
to where the rock has been hewn away into a series of chambers
and ledges. Here images lie by the score in all stages of evolution,
just as they were left when, for some unknown reason, the
workmen laid down their tools for the last time and the busy
scene was still. Here, as elsewhere, the wonder of the place can
only be appreciated as the eye becomes trained to see. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>majority of cases the statues still form part of the rock, and are
frequently covered with lichen or overgrown with grass and
ferns; and even in the illustrations, for which prominent figures
have naturally been chosen, the reader may find that he has to
look more than once in order to recognise the form. A conspicuous
one first strikes the beholder: as he gazes, he finds with
surprise that the walls on either hand are themselves being
wrought into figures, and that, resting in a niche above him, is
another giant; he looks down, and realises with a start that his
foot is resting on a mighty face. To the end of our visit we
occasionally found a figure which had escaped observation.</p>

<div id='f_048'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='right'>Fig. 48.</span><br><br><span class='sc'>Diagram of Rano Raraku.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The workings on the exterior of Raraku first attract attention;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>here their size, and incidentally that of many of the
statues, has largely been determined by fissures in the hillside,
which run vertically and at distances of perhaps 40 feet. The
quarries have been worked differently, and each has a character
of its own. In some of them the principal figures lie in steps,
with their length parallel to the hill’s horizontal axis; one of
this type is reached through a narrow opening in the rock, and
recalls the side-chapel of some old cathedral, save that nature’s
blue sky forms the only roof (no. 74, fig. 60); immediately opposite
the doorway there lies, on a base of rock, in quiet majesty,
a great recumbent figure. So like is it to some ancient effigy that
the awed spectator involuntarily catches his breath, as if suddenly
brought face to face with a tomb of the mighty dead. Once, on
a visit to this spot, a rather quaint little touch of nature supervened:
going there early in the morning, with the sunlight still
sparkling on the floor of dewy grass, a wild-cat, startled by our
approach, rushed away from the rock above, and the natives,
clambering up, found nestling beneath a statue at a high level
a little family of blind kittens.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other instances the images have been carved lying, not
horizontally, but vertically, with sometimes the head, and
sometimes the base, toward the summit of the hill. But no
exact system has been followed, the figures are found in all places,
and all positions. When there was a suitable piece of rock it
has been carved into a statue, without any special regard to surroundings
or direction. Interspersed with embryo and completed
images are empty niches from which others have already been
removed; and finished statues must, in some cases, have been
passed out over the top of those still in course of construction.
From all the outside quarries is seen the same wonderful panorama:
immediately beneath are the statues which stand on the
lower slopes; farther still lie the prostrate ones beside the approach;
while beyond is the whole stretch of the southern plain,
with its white line of breaking surf ending in the western mountain
of Rano Kao (fig. 54).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>The quarries within the crater are on the same lines as those
without, save that those on the south-eastern side form a more
continuous whole. Here the most striking position is on the top
of the seaward cliff, in the centre of which is a large finished image
(no. 16, fig. 47); on one side the ground falls away more or
less steeply to the crater lake, on the other a stone thrown down
would reach the foot of the precipice; the view extends from sea
to sea. Over all the most absolute stillness reigns.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statues in the quarries number altogether over 150.
Amongst this mass of material there is no difficulty in tracing
the course of the work. The surface of the rock, which will
form the figure, has generally been laid bare before work upon
it began, but occasionally the image was wrought lying partially
under a canopy (fig. 49). In a few cases the stone has been
roughed out into preliminary blocks (no. 58, fig. 60), but this
procedure is not universal, and seems to have been followed
only where there was some doubt as to the quality of the material.
When this was not the case the face and anterior aspect of the
statue were first carved, and the block gradually became isolated
as the material was removed in forming the head, base, and sides.
A gutter or alley-way was thus made round the image
(fig. 55), in which the niches where each man has stood or squatted
to his work can be clearly seen; it is, therefore, possible to
count how many were at work at each side of a figure.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the front and sides were completed down to every
detail of the hands, the undercutting commenced. The rock
beneath was chipped away by degrees till the statue rested
only on a narrow strip of stone running along the spine;
those which have been left at this stage resemble precisely
a boat on its keel, the back being curved in the same way
as a ship’s bottom (fig. 50). In the next stage shown the
figure is completely detached from the rock, and chocked
up by stones, looking as if an inadvertent touch would send
it sliding down the hill into the plain below (fig. 51). In one
instance the moving has evidently begun, the image having
been shifted out of the straight. In another very interesting
case the work has been abandoned when the statue was in
the middle of its descent; it has been carved in a horizontal
position in the highest part of the quarry, where its empty
niche is visible, it has then been slewed round and was being
launched, base forward, across some other empty niches at a
lower level. The bottom now rests on the floor of the quarry,
and the figure, which has broken in half, is supported in a standing
fashion against the outer edge of the vacated shelves. The first
impression was that it had met with an accident in transit, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>been abandoned; but it is at least equally possible that for the
purpose of bringing it down, a bank or causeway of earth had
been built up to level the inequalities of the descent, and that it
was resting on this when the work came to an end; the soil
would then in time be washed away, and the figure fracture
through loss of support.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the quarry which is shown in fig. 54, the finished head
can be seen lying across the opening, the body is missing, presumably
broken off and buried; the bottom of the keel on which
the figure at one time rested can be clearly traced in a projecting
line of rock down the middle of its old bed, also the different
sections where the various men employed have chipped away
the stone in undermining the statue. In the quarry wall the
niches occupied by the sculptors are also visible, at more than
one level, the higher ones being discarded when the upper
portion of the work was finished and a lower station needed.
The hand of the standing boy in fig. 51 rests on a small platform
similarly abandoned.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>The tools were found with which the work has been done. One
type of these can be seen lying about in great abundance (fig. 52).
They are of the same material as the lapilli in the statues, and
made by flaking. Some specimens are pointed at both ends,
others have one end more or less rounded. It is unlikely that
they were hafted, and they were probably held in the hand
when in use. They were apparently discarded as soon as the
point became damaged. There is another tool much more
carefully made, an adze blade, with the lower end bevelled
off to form the cutting edge. In the specimen shown, the top
is much abraded apparently from hammering with a maul or
mallet (fig. 53). These are rarely found, the probability being
that they were too precious to leave and were taken home
by the workmen. The whole process was not necessarily
very lengthy; a calculation of the number of men who could
work at the stone at the same time, and the amount each could
accomplish, gave the rather surprising result that a statue
might be roughed out within the space of fifteen days. The
most notable part of the work was the skill which kept the
figure so perfect in design and balance that it was subsequently
able to maintain its equilibrium in a standing position; to this
it is difficult to pay too high a tribute.</p>

<p class='c007'>It remains to account for the vast number of images to be
found in the quarry. A certain number have, no doubt, been
abandoned prior to the general cessation of the work; in some
cases a flaw has been found in the rock and the original plan has
had to be given up—in this case, part of the stone is sometimes
used for either a smaller image or one cut at a different angle.
In other instances the sculptors have been unlucky enough to
come across at important points one or more of the hard nodules
with which their tools could not deal, and as the work could not
go down to posterity with a large wart on its nose or excrescence
on its chin, it has had to be stopped. But when all these instances
have been subtracted, the amount of figures remaining
in the quarries is still startlingly large when compared with the
number which have been taken out of it, and must have necessitated,
if they were all in hand at once, a number of workers out
of all proportion to any population which the island has ever
been likely to have maintained. The theory naturally suggests
itself that some were merely rock carvings and not intended to
be removed. It is one which needs to be adopted with caution,
for more than once, where every appearance has pointed to its
being correct, a similar neighbour has been found which was
actually being removed; on the whole, however, there can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>little doubt that it is at any rate a partial solution of the problem.
Some of the images are little more than embossed carvings on
the face of the rock without surrounding alley-ways. In one
instance, inside the crater, a piece of rock which has been left
standing on the very summit of the cliff has been utilised in
such a way that the figure lies on its side, while its back is formed
by the outward precipice (fig. 56); this is contrary to all usual
methods, and it seems improbable that it was intended to make
it into a standing statue. Perhaps the strongest evidence is
afforded by the size of some of the statues: the largest (fig. 55;
no. 64, fig. 60) is 66 feet in length, whereas 36 feet is the extreme
ever found outside the quarry; tradition, it is true, points
out the ahu on the south coast for which this monster was
designed, but it is difficult to believe it was ever intended
to move such a mass. If this theory is correct, it would be
interesting to know whether the stage of carving came first, and
that of removal followed, as the workmen became more expert;
or whether it was the result of decadence when labour may have
become scarce. It is, of course, possible that the two methods
proceeded concurrently, rock carvings being within the means
of those who could not procure the labour necessary to move
the statue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Legendary lore throws no light on these matters, nor on the
reasons which led to the desertion of this labyrinth of work; it
has invented a story which entirely satisfies the native mind
and is repeated on every occasion. There was a certain old
woman who lived at the southern corner of the mountain and
filled the position of cook to the image-makers. She was the
most important person of the establishment, and moved the
images by supernatural power (<em>mana</em>), ordering them about at
her will. One day, when she was away, the workers obtained a
fine lobster, which had been caught on the west coast, and ate
it up, leaving none for her; unfortunately they forgot to conceal
the remains, and when the cook returned and found how she
had been treated, she arose in her wrath, told all the images to
fall down, and thus brought the work to a standstill.</p>

base on level ground (nos. 1, 2, 3, fig. 60), extending from the
exterior of the entrance to the crater to the southern corner;
these are all prostrate. On the slopes there are a few horizontal
statues, but the great majority, both inside the crater and without,
are still erect. Outside, some forty figures stand in an
irregular belt, reaching from the corner nearest the sea to about
half-way to the gap leading into the crater. The bottom of the
mountain is here diversified by little hillocks and depressions;
these hillocks would have made commanding situations, but
rather curiously the statues, while erected quite close to them,
and even on their sides, are never on the top. Inside the crater,
where some twenty statues are still erect, the arrangement is
rather more regular; but, on the whole, they are put up in no
apparent order. All stood with their backs to the mountain.</p>

<p class='c007'>They vary very considerably in size; the tallest which could
be measured from its base was 32 feet 3 inches, while others
are not much above 11 feet. Every statue is buried in greater
or less degree, but while some are exposed as far as the elbow,
in others only a portion of the top of the head can be seen above
the surface (fig. 57), others no doubt are covered entirely. The
number visible must vary from time to time, as by the movement
of the earth some are buried and others disclosed. An old man,
whose testimony was generally reliable, stated, when speaking
of the figures on the outside of the mountain, that while those
nearer the sea were in the same condition as he always remembered
them, those farther from it were now more deeply buried
than in his youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Various old people were brought out from the village at
Hanga Roa to pay visits to the camp, but the information
forthcoming was never of great extent; one elderly gentleman in
particular took much more interest in roaming round the mountain,
recalling various scenes of his youth, than in anything
connected with the statues. A few names are still remembered
in connection with the individual figures, and are said to be those
of the makers of the images, and some proof is afforded of the
reality of the tradition by the fact that the clans of the persons
named are consistently given. Another class of names is,
however, obviously derived merely from local circumstances;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>one in the quarry, under a drip from above, is known by the
equivalent for “Dropping Water,” while a series inside the
crater are called after the birds which frequent the cliff-side,
“Kia-kia, Flying,” “Kia-kia, Sitting,” and so forth. A solitary
legend relates to an unique figure, resembling rather a block
than an image, which lies on the surface on the outside of the
mountain (no. 24, fig. 60). It is the single exception to the rule
mentioned above, that no evolution can be traced in the statues
on the island. The usual conception is there, and the hands
are shown, but the head seems to melt into the body and the
ear and arm to have become confused. It is said to have been
the first image made and is known as Tai-haré-atua, which
tradition says was the name of the maker. He found himself
unable to fashion it properly, and went over to the other side
of the island to consult with a man who lived near Hanga Roa,
named Rauwai-ika. He stayed the night there, but the expert
remained silent, and he was retiring disappointed in the morning,
when he was followed by his host, who called him back. “Make
your image,” said he, “like me,”—that is, in form of a man.</p>

<p class='c007'>On our first visit to the mountain, overcome by the wonder
of the scene, we turned to our Fernandez boy and asked him
what he thought of the statues. Like the classical curate, when
the bishop inquired as to the character of his egg, he struggled
manfully between the desire to please and a sense of truth; like
the curate, he took refuge in compromise. “Some of them,” he
said doubtfully, he thought “were very nice.” If the figures
at first strike even the cultured observer as crude and archaic,
it must be remembered that not only are they the work of stone
tools, but to be rightly seen should not be scrutinised near at
hand. “Hoa-haka-nanaia,” for instance, is wholly and dismally
out of place under a smoky portico, but on the slopes of a mountain,
gazing in impenetrable calm over sea and land, the simplicity
of outline is soon found to be marvellously impressive.
The longer the acquaintance the more this feeling strengthens;
there is always the sense of quiet dignity, of suggestion and of
mystery.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>While the scene on Raraku always arouses a species of awe,
it is particularly inspiring at sunset, when, as the light fades,
the images gradually become outlined as stupendous black
figures against the gorgeous colouring of the west. The most
striking sight witnessed on the island was a fire on the hillside;
in order to see our work more clearly we set alight the long dry
grass, always a virtuous act on Easter Island that the livestock
may have the benefit of fresh shoots; in a moment the whole
was a blaze, the mountain, wreathed in masses of driving smoke,
grew to portentous size, the quarries loomed down from above
as dark giant masses, and in the whirl of flame below the great
statues stood out calmly, with a quiet smile, like stoical souls
in Hades.</p>

<p class='c007'>The questions which arise are obvious: do these buried statues
differ in any way from those in the workings above, from those
on the ahu or from one another? were they put up on any
foundation? and, above all, what is the history of the mountain
and the <i><span lang="fr">raison d’être</span></i> of the figures? In the hope of throwing
some light on these problems we started to dig them out. It
had originally been thought that the excavation of one or
two would give all the information which it was possible to
obtain, but each case was found to have unique and instructive
features, and we finally unearthed in this way, wholly or in part,
some twenty or thirty statues. It was usually easy to trace
the stages by which the figures had been gradually covered. On
the top was a layer of surface soil, from 3 to 8 inches in
depth; then came debris, which had descended from the quarry
above in the form of rubble, it contained large numbers of chisels,
some forty of which have been found in digging out one statue;
below this was the substance in which a hole had been dug to
erect the image, it sometimes consisted of clay and occasionally
in part of rock. Not unfrequently the successive descents of
earth could be traced by the thin lines of charcoal which marked
the old surfaces, obviously the result of grass or brushwood fires.
The few statues which are in a horizontal position are always
on the surface (no. 31, fig. 60), and at first give the impression that
they have been abandoned in the course of being brought down
from the quarries; as they are frequently found close to standing
images, of which only the head is visible, it follows that, if this
is the correct solution, the work must still have been proceeding
when the earlier statues were already largely submerged. The
juxtaposition, however, occurs so often that it seems, on the
whole, more probable that the rush of earth which covered
some, upset the foundations of others, and either threw them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>down where they stood or carried them with it on top of the
flood. These various landslips allow of no approximate deductions
as to the date, in the manner which is possible with
successively deposited layers of earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>To get absolutely below the base of an image was not altogether
easy. The first we attempted to dig out was one of the farther
ones within the crater (no. 19, fig. 47); it was found that, while
the back of the hole into which it had been dropped was
excavated in the soft volcanic ash, the front and remaining
sides were of hard rock. This rock was cut to the curvature of
the figure at a distance of some 3 inches from it, and as the
chisel marks were horizontal, from right to left, the workmen
must have stood in the cup while preparing it: in clearing out
the alluvium between the wall of the cup and the figure, six stone
implements were found. The hands, which were about 1 foot
below the level of the rim, were perfectly formed. The next
statue chosen for excavation was also inside the crater (no. 107,
fig. 47); it was most easily attacked from the side, and this
time it was possible to get low enough to see that it stood on no
foundation, and that the base instead of expanding, as with
those which stood on the ahu, contracted in such a manner as
to give a peg-shaped appearance; this confirmed the impression
made by the previous excavation, that the image was intended
to remain in its hole and was not, as some have stated, merely
awaiting removal to an ahu (fig. 62).</p>

<p class='c007'>The story was shown not only in the sections of the excavation,
but in the degrees of weathering on the figure itself: the lowest
part of the image to above the elbow exhibited, by the sharpness
of its outlines and frequently of the chisel cuts also, that it had
never been exposed, the other portions being worn in relative
degrees. Traces of the smoothness of the original surface can
still be seen above-ground in the more protected portions of some
of the statues, such as in the orbit and under the chin (see
frontispiece); but a much clearer impression is of course gained
of the finish and detail of the image when the unweathered surface
is exposed. The polish is often very beautiful, and pieces of
pumice, called “punga,” are found, with which the figures are said
to have been rubbed down. The fingers taper, and the excessive
length of the thumb-joint and nail are remarkable (fig. 72).
The nipples are in some cases so pronounced that the natives
often characterised them as feminine, but in no case which we
came across did the statues represent other than the nude male
figure<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a>; the navel is indicated by a raised disc. On the statue
with the contracting base, which is one of the best, the surface
modelling of the elbow-joint is clearly shown. The orbital
cavity in the figures on Raraku is rather differently modelled
from those on the ahu; in the statues on the mountain the
position of the eyeball is always indicated by a straight line
below the brow, the orbit has no lower border (fig. 72). On the
terraces the socket is constantly hollowed out as in the figure at
the British Museum (fig. 31).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The eye is the only point in which the two sets vary, with
the important exception that some on the mountain have a type
of back which never appears on the ahu. This question of back
proved to be of special interest: in some images it remained
exactly as when the figure left the quarry, the whole was convex,
giving it a thick and archaic appearance, particularly as regards
the neck; in other instances, the posterior was beautifully
modelled after the same fashion as those on the terraces, the
stone had been carefully chipped away till the ears stood out
from the back of the head, the neck assumed definite form, and
the spine, instead of standing out as a sharp ridge, was represented
by an incised line. This second type, when excavated,
proved, to our surprise, to possess a well-carved design in
the form of a girdle shown by three raised bands, this was
surmounted by one or sometimes by two rings, and immediately
beneath it was another design somewhat in the shape of an
M (figs. 64 and 106). The whole was new, not only to us, but
to the natives, who greatly admired it. Later, when we knew
what to look for, traces of the girdle could be seen also on the
figures on the ahu where the arm had protected it from the
weather. It was afterwards realised with amusement that the
discovery of this design might have been made before leaving
England by merely passing the barrier and walking behind the
statues in the Bloomsbury portico. One case was found, a
statue at Anakena, where a ring was visible, not only on the
back but also on each of the buttocks, and in view of subsequent
information these lower rings became of special importance. The
girdle in this case consisted of one line only; the detail of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>carving had doubtless been preserved by being buried in the
sand (fig. 65). The two forms of back, unmodelled and modelled,
stand side by side on the mountain (figs. 66, 67).</p>

<p class='c007'>The next step was to discover where and when the modelling
was done. Certainly not in the original place in the quarry,
where it would be impossible from the position in which the
image was evolved; generally speaking there was no trace of
such work, and it was not until many months later that new
light was thrown on the matter. Then it was remarked that in
one of the standing statues on the outside of the hill, which was
buried up to the neck (fig. 59), while the right ear was most
carefully modelled, showing a disc, the left ear was as yet quite
plain, and that the back of the head also was not symmetrical.
Excavations made clear that the whole back was in course of
transformation from the boat-shaped to the modelled type, each
workman apparently chipping away where it seemed to him
good (fig. 68). Two or three similar cases were then found on
which work was proceeding; but on the other hand, some of the
simpler backs were excavated to the foot, and others a considerable
distance, and there was no indication that any alteration
was intended. There are three possible explanations for these
erect and partially moulded statues: Firstly, it may have been
the regular method for the back to be completed after the statue
was set up, in which case some kind of staging must have been
used; one of our guides had made a remark, noted, but not
taken very seriously at the moment, that “the statues were set
up to be finished”; some knowledge or tradition of such work,
therefore, appeared to linger. Secondly, the convex back may
be the older form, and those on which work was being done were
being modelled to bring them up-to-date. Alteration did at
times take place; a certain small image presented a very curious
appearance both from the proportion of the body, which was
singularly narrow from back to front, and because it was difficult
to see how it remained in place as it was apparently exposed to
the base; it turned out that the figure had been carved out of
the head of an older statue, of which the body was buried below
(no. 14, fig. 60). Thirdly, these particular figures may have
been erected and left in an unfinished condition; if so, their
deficiencies were high up and would be obvious.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Scamping did not often occur, and when it did so it was in
the concealed portions. In one case the left hand was correctly
modelled, but the right was not even indicated beyond the wrist
(fig. 63). The statue shown in the frontispiece, which rejoices
in the name of Piro-piro, meaning “bad odour,”<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> stands at the
foot of the slope, and appears to remain as it was set up
without further burial. It is a well-made figure, probably one
of the most recent, and the upper part of the back is carefully
moulded, but on digging it out it was found that the bottom had
not been finished, but left in the form of a rough excrescence of
stone; there was no ring, but a girdle had been carved on the
protruding portion, so that this was not intended to be removed.
In another instance a large head had fallen on a slope at such
an angle that it was impossible to locate the position of the body;
curiosity led to investigation, when it was found that the thing
was a fraud, the magnificent head being attached to a little
dwarf trunk, which must have been buried originally nearly to
the neck to keep the top upright. These instances of “jerry-building”
confirm our impression that at any rate a large
number of the statues were intended to remain <i><span lang="co">in situ</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Indications were found of two different methods of erection,
and the mode may have been determined by the nature of the
ground. By the first procedure the statue seems to have been
placed on its face in the desired spot, and a hole to have been dug
beneath the base. The other method was to undermine the
base, with the statue lying face uppermost; in several instances
a number of large stones were found behind the back of the figure,
evidently having been used to wedge it while it was dragged
to the vertical. The upright position had sometimes been only
partially attained; one statue was still in a slanting attitude,
corresponding exactly to the slope of a hard clay wall behind it;
the interval between the two, varying from three yards to
eighteen inches, had been packed with sub-angular boulders
which weighed about one hundredweight, or as much as a man
could lift (fig. 69).</p>

<p class='c007'>A few of the figures bear incised markings rudely, and apparently
promiscuously, carved. This was first noted in the case
of one of two statues which stand together nearest to the entrance
of the crater; here it has been found possible to work the rock
at a low level, and in the empty quarry, from which they no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>doubt have been taken, two images have been set up, one slightly
in front of the other; six still unfinished figures lie in close
proximity (figs. 70 and 71). The standing figure, nearest to
the lake, bore a rough design on the face, and when it was dug
out the back was found to be covered with similar incised marks.
The natives were much excited, and convinced that we should
receive a large sum of money in England when the photograph
of these was produced, for nothing ever dispelled the illusion that
the expedition was a financial speculation. It was these carvings
more especially that we ourselves hastily endeavoured to
cover up when, on the arrival of Admiral von Spee’s Squadron,
we daily expected a visit from the officers on board. The
markings have certainly not been made by the same practised
hand as the raised girdle and rings, and appear to be comparatively
recent (fig. 64). Other statues were excavated, where
similar marks were noticed, but, except in this case, digging led
practically always to disappointment. It was the part above
the surface only which had been used as a block on which to
scrawl design, from the same impulse presumably as impels the
school-boy of to-day to make marks with chalk on a hoarding.
On one ahu the top of the head of a statue has been decorated
with rough faces, the carving evidently having been done after
the statue had fallen.</p>

<p class='c007'>In digging out the image with the tattooed back, we came
across the one and only burial which was found in connection
with these figures; it was close to it and at the level of the rings.
The long bones, the patella, and base of the skull were identified;
they lay in wet soil, crushed and intermixed with large stones,
so the attitude could not be determined beyond the fact that the
head was to the right of the image and the long bones to the
left. These bones had become of the consistency of moist clay,
and could only be identified by making transverse sections of
them with a knife, after first cleaning portions longitudinally
by careful scraping.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>In several other instances human bones were discovered near
the statues, but, like the carvings, they appeared to be of later
date than the images. One skull was found beneath a figure
which was lying face downwards on the surface; another fragment
must have been placed behind the base after the statue had
fallen forward. The natives stated that in the epidemics which
ravaged the island the statues afforded a natural mark for
depositing remains. In the same way a head near an ahu, which
was at first thought to be that of a standing statue, turned out
to be broken from the trunk and put up pathetically to mark
the grave of a little child. There is a roughly constructed ahu
on the outside of Rano Raraku at the corner nearest to the sea,
of which more will be said hereafter, and a quarried block of
rock on the very top of the westerly peak was also said to be
used for the exposure of the dead (no. 75, fig. 47). Close to
this block there are some very curious circular pits cut in
the rock; one examined was 5 feet 6 inches in depth and
3 feet 6 inches in diameter (no. 74, fig. 47). It is possible
they were used as vaults, but, if so, the shape is quite different
from those of the ahu. The conclusion arrived at was that
the statues themselves were not directly connected with burials.
There seems also no reason to believe that they are put up in
any order or method; they appear to have been erected on any
spot handy to the quarries where there was sufficient earth, or
even, as has been seen, in the quarry itself when circumstances
permitted.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The South-Eastern Side of Rano Raraku</em> is a problem in itself.
The great wall formed by the cliff is like the ramparts of some
giant castle rent by vertical fissures. The greatest height, the
top of the peak, is about five hundred feet, of which the cliff
forms perhaps half, the lower part being a steep but comparatively
smooth bank of detritus. Over the grassy surface of this
bank are scattered numerous fragments of rock, weighing from
a few pounds to many tons, which have fallen down from above.
The kitchen tent in our camp at the foot had a narrow escape from
being demolished by one of these stones, which nearly carried it
away in the impetus of its descent. It has never been suggested
that this face of the mountain was being worked, nevertheless, it
was subsequently difficult to understand how we lived so long
below it, gazing at it daily, before we appreciated the fact that
here also, although in much lesser degree, were both finished and
embryo images. At last one stone was definitely seen to be in
the form of a head, and excavation showed it to be an erected
and buried statue. A few other figures were found standing
and prostrate, and some unfinished images; these last, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>were in no case being hewn out of solid rock, but wrought into
shape out of detached stones. On the whole, it is not probable
that this portion was ever a quarry, in the same way as the
western side and the interior of the crater. It is, of course,
impossible to say what may be hidden beneath the detritus, but
the lower part of the cliff is too soft a rock to be satisfactorily
hewn, and the workmen appear simply to have seized on fragments
which have fallen from above. “Here,” they seem to have
said, “is a good stone; let us turn it into a statue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, when making a more thorough examination of the
slope, our attention was excited by a small level plateau, about
half-way up, from which protruded two similar pieces of stone
next to one another. They were obviously giant noses of which
the nostrils faced the cliff. Digging was bound to follow, but it
proved a long business, as the figures it revealed were particularly
massive and corpulent. Their position was horizontal, side by
side, and the effect, more particularly when looking down at
them from the cliff above, was of two great bodies lying in their
graves (fig. 73). The thing was a mystery; they were certainly
not in a quarry, but if they had once been erect, why had they
faced the mountain, instead of conforming to the rule of having
their back to it? Orientation could not account for it, as other
statues on the same slope were differently placed. Then again,
if they had once stood and then fallen, and in proof of this one
head was broken off from the trunk, how did it come about that
they were lying horizontally on a sloping hillside? The upper
part of the bodies had suffered somewhat from weather, and a
small round basin, such as natives use for domestic purposes,
had been hollowed out in one abdomen, but the hands were quite
sharp and unweathered. We used to scramble up at off moments,
and stand gazing down at them trying to read their history.</p>

<p class='c007'>It became at last obvious they had once been set up with the
lower part inserted in the ground to the usual level, and later
been intentionally thrown down. For this purpose a level
trench must have been cut through the sloping side of the hill
at a depth corresponding to the base of the standing images, and
into this the figures had fallen. While they lay in the trench
with the upper part of the bodies exposed, one had been found
a nice smooth stone for household use. A charcoal soil level
showed clearly where the surface had been at this epoch, which
must have been comparatively recent, as an iron nail was found
in it. Finally, a descent of earth had covered all but the noses,
leaving them in the condition in which we found them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>This, though a satisfactory explanation as far as it went, did
not account for the fact that the figures were facing the mountain,
and here for once tradition came to our help. These images had,
it was said, marked a boundary; the line of demarcation led
between them, from the fissure in the cliff above right down to
the middle statue in the great Tongariki terrace. To cross
it was death; but as to what the boundary connoted no information
was forthcoming; there seemed no great tribal
division—the same clans ranged over the whole of the district.
When, however, the line is followed through the crevice into the
crater (fig. 47), it is found to form on both sides the boundary
where the image-making ceased (no. 1 is a detached figure
being brought down, not in a quarry), and was probably the line
of taboo which preserved the rights of the image-makers. I
was later given the cheering information that a certain “devil”
frequented the site of my house, which was just on the image side
of the boundary, who particularly resented the presence of
strangers, and was given to strangling them in the night. The
spirits, who inhabit the crater, are still so unpleasant, that my
Kanaka maid objected to taking clothes there to wash, even in
daylight, till assured that our party would be working within call.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Isolated Statues.</em>—The finished statues, as distinct from those
in the quarries, have so far been spoken of under two heads,
those which once adorned the ahu and those still standing on
the slope of Raraku; there is, however, another class to consider,
which, for want of a better name, will be termed the Isolated
Statues. It has already been stated that, as Raraku is approached,
a number of figures lie by the side of the modern track,
others are round the base of the mountain, and yet other isolated
specimens are scattered about the island. All these images are
prostrate and lie on the surface of the ground, some on their
backs and some on their faces. These were the ones which,
according to legend, were being moved from the quarries to the
ahu by the old lady when she stopped the work in her wrath;
or, according to another account, quoted by a visitor before our
day, “They walked, and some fell by the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>There must, we felt, have been roads along which they were
taken, but for long we kept a look-out for such without
success. At last a lazy Sunday afternoon ride, with no particular
object, took one of us to the top of a small hill,
some two miles to the west of Raraku. The level rays of
the sinking sun showed up the inequalities of the ground,
and, looking towards the sea, along the level plain of the
south coast, the old track was clearly seen; it was slightly
raised over lower ground and depressed somewhat through
higher, and along it every few hundred yards lay a statue.
Detailed study confirmed this first impression. At times over
hard stony ground the trail was lost, but its main drift was
indisputable; it was about nine feet or ten feet in width, the
embankments were in places two feet above the surrounding
ground, and the cuttings three feet deep. The road can be traced
from the south-western corner of the mountain, with one or two
gaps, nearly to the foot of Rano Kao, but the succession of statues
continues only about half the distance. It generally runs some
few hundred yards further inland than the present road, but
a branch, with a statue, leads down to the ahu of Tea-tenga
on the coast, and, another portion, either a branch or a
detour of the main road, also with a statue, goes to the cove of
Akahanga with its two large image ahu (fig. 32). There are
on this road twenty-seven statues in all, covering a distance
of some four miles, but fourteen of them, including two groups
of three, are in the first mile. Their heights are from fifteen feet
to over thirty feet, but generally over twenty feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a clue had now been obtained, it was comparatively
simple to trace two other roads from Raraku. One leads
from the crater, and connects it with the western district
of the island. It commences at the gap in the mountain wall,
in the centre of which an image lies on its face with weird
effect, as if descending head foremost into the plain; and runs for
a while roughly parallel to the first road but about a mile
further inland. It is not quite so regular as the south road, and
is marked for a somewhat less distance by a sequence of images,
some fourteen in number, which in the same way grow further
apart as the distance from the mountain increases. When the
succession of statues ceases, the road divides; one track turns
to the north-west, and reaches the seaboard through a small
pass in the western line of cones; the other continues as far as
a more southerly pass in the same succession of heights. In
each pass there is a statue.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>The third road, which runs from Raraku in a northerly direction,
is much shorter than those to the south and west. It has
only four statues covering a distance of perhaps a mile, and
it then disappears; if, however, the figures round the base of
the mountain belonged to it, and they lie in the same direction,
it started from the southern corner of the mountain, led in
front of the standing statues and across the trail from the crater,
before taking its northward route up the eastern plain. The
furthest of the images is the largest which has been moved; it
lies on its back, badly broken, but the total of the fragments gives
a height of thirty-six feet four inches. In addition to these three
avenues, there are indications that some of the statues on the
south-eastern side of Raraku may have been on a fourth road
along that side beneath the cliff.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far the matter was sufficiently clear, but another problem
was still unsolved: if the images were really being moved to their
respective ahu all round the coast, how was it that, with very few
exceptions, they were all found in the neighbourhood of Raraku?
If also they were being moved, what was the method pursued,
for some lay on their backs and some on their faces? With the
hope of elucidating this great question of the means of transport,
we dug under and near one or two of the single figures without
achieving our end—nothing was found; but the close study
which the work necessitated called attention to the fact that on
one of them the lines of weathering could not have been made
with the figure in its present horizontal attitude. The rain had
evidently collected on the head and run down the back; it must
therefore have stood for a considerable time in a vertical position.
It was again a noticeable fact that, though some single figures
are lying unbroken (fig. 75), others, like the large one on the north
road, proved to be so shattered that no amount of normal disintegration
or shifting of soil could account for their condition—they
had obviously fallen. So wedded, however, were we at
this time to the theory that they were in course of transport,
that it was seriously considered whether they could have been
moved in an upright position. The point was settled by finding
one day by the side of the track, some two miles from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>mountain, a partially buried head. This was excavated, and a
statue found that had been originally set up in a hole and, later,
undermined, causing it to fall forward. This was the only
instance of an isolated figure where the burial had been to any
depth, but in various other cases it was then seen that soil had
been removed from the base, and one or two more of the figures
had not quite fallen (fig. 76).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When the whole number of the statues on the roads were
in imagination re-erected, it was found that they had all
originally stood with their backs to the hill. Rano Raraku
was, therefore, approached by at least three magnificent avenues,
on each of which the pilgrim was greeted at intervals by a
stone giant guarding the way to the sacred mountain (map of
roads). One of the ahu on the south coast, Hanga Paukura,
has been approached by a similar avenue of five statues facing
the visitor. These five images when first seen were a great
puzzle, as some of them are so embedded in the earth that their
backs are even with the levelled sward in front of the ahu; later
there seemed little doubt that, like the two giants on the south-east
side of Raraku, trenches had been dug into which they had
fallen. Subsequently, a sixth statue was discovered, the other
side of a modern wall, weathered and worn away, but of Raraku
stone and still upright. This is the only instance of an erect
figure to be found elsewhere than on the mountain (fig. 77).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>In addition to the images which have stood in these processional
roads, there are, excluding one or two figures near the
mountain whose <i><span lang="fr">raison d’être</span></i> is somewhat doubtful, fourteen
isolated statues in various parts of the island, for whose position
no certain reason could be found. Some of these may have
belonged to inland ahu which have disappeared, or they may
be solitary memorials to mark some particular spots, but the
greater number appear to have stood near tracks of some sort.
Some of these last may have been boundary stones, and in this
class may perhaps fall the smaller statue now at the British
Museum, which is a very inferior specimen. According to local
information it stood almost half-way on the track leading from
Vinapu to Mataveri along the bottom of Rano Kao; the hole
from which it was dug was pointed out, and our informant
declared that he remembered it standing, and that the people
used to dance round it. The larger figure at the British Museum
was in a unique position, which will be spoken of later.</p>

<p class='c007'>No statues were, therefore, found of which it could be said
that they were in process of being removed, and the mode of
transport remains a mystery. An image could be moved down
from the quarry by means of banks of earth, and though requiring
labour and skill, the process is not inconceivable. Similarly, the
figures may have been, and probably were, erected on the terraces
in the same way, being hauled up on an embankment of earth
made higher than the pedestals and then dropped on them.
Near Paro, the ahu where the last statue was overthrown, there
is a hillock, and tradition says that a causeway was made from
it to the head of the tall figure which stood upon the ahu, and
along this the hat was rolled (fig. 78)—a piece of lore which
seems hardly likely to have been invented by a race having no
connection with the statues. But the problem remains, how
was the transport carried out along the level? The weight of
some amounted to as much as 40 or 50 tons. It would simplify
matters very much if there were any reason to suppose that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>images were moved, as was the case with the hats, before being
wrought, merely as cylinders of stone, in which case it would be
possible to pass a rope under and over it, thus parbuckling the
stone or rolling it along, but the evidence is all to the contrary.
There is no trace whatever of an unfinished image on or near an
ahu, while, as we have seen, they are found at all stages in the
quarry. Presumably rollers were employed, but there appears
never to have been much wood, or material for cordage, in the
island, and it is not easy to see how sufficient men could bring
strength to bear on the block. Even if the ceremonial roads
were used when possible, these fragile figures have been taken
to many distant ahu, up hill and down dale, over rough and stony
ground, where there is no trace of any road at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natives are sometimes prepared to state that the statues
were thrown down by human means, they never have any
doubt that they were moved by supernatural power. We were
once inspecting an ahu built on a natural eminence, one side
was sheer cliff, the other was a slope of 29 feet, as steep as a
house roof, near the top a statue was lying. The most intelligent
of our guides turned to me significantly. “Do you mean
to tell me,” he said, “that that was not done by <em>mana</em>?”
The darkness is not rendered less tantalising by the reflection
that could centuries roll away and the old scenes be again
enacted before us, the workers would doubtless exclaim in
bewildered surprise at our ignorance, “But how could you do it
any other way?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the ceremonial roads and their continuations, there
are traces of an altogether different track which is said to run
round the whole seaboard of the island. It is considered to be
supernatural work, and is known as Ara Mahiva, “ara” meaning
road and “Mahiva” being the name of the spirit or deity who made
it. On the southern side it has been obliterated in making the
present track—it was there termed the “path for carrying fish”;
but on the northern and western coasts, where for much of the
way it runs on the top of high cliffs, such a use is out of the
question. It can be frequently seen there like a long persistent
furrow, and where its course has been interrupted by erosion,
no fresh track had been made further inland; it terminates
suddenly on the broken edge, and resumes its course on the other
side. It is best seen in certain lights running up both the western
and southern edges of Rano Kao. Its extent and regularity
appeared to preclude the idea of landslip. There is no reason
to suppose that it is due to the imported livestock, and it has no
connection with ahu, or the old native centres of population,
yet to have been so worn by naked feet it must constantly have
been used. This silent witness to a forgotten past is one of the
most mysterious and impressive things on the island.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Stone Crowns of the Images</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Mention must finally be made of the crowns or hats which
adorned the figures on the ahu. Their full designation is said
to be “Hau (hats) hiterau moai,” but they are always alluded
to merely as “hiterau” or “hitirau.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These coverings for the head were cylindrical in form, the
bottom being slightly hollowed out into an oval depression in
order to fit on to the head of the image; the depression was not
in the centre, but left a larger margin in front, so that the brim
projected over the eyes of the figure, a fashion common in native
head-dresses. They are said by the present inhabitants to have
been kept in place by being wedged with white stones. The
top was worked into a boss or knot. The material is a red
volcanic tuff found in a small crater on the side of a larger
volcano, generally known as Punapau, not far from Cook’s
Bay (fig. 79). In the crater itself are the old quarries. A
few half-buried hats may be seen there, and the path up
to it, and for some hundreds of yards from the foot of the
mountain, is strewn with them. They are at this stage
simply large cylinders, from 4 feet to 8 feet high, from 6 feet
to 9 feet across (fig. 80), and they were obviously conveyed to
the ahu in this form and there carved into shape (fig. 81). An
unwrought cylinder is still lying at a hundred yards from the
ahu of Anakena. The finished hats are not more than 3 feet
10 inches to 6 feet in height, with addition of 6 inches to 2 feet
for the knob; the measurement across the crown is from about
5 feet 6 inches to 8 feet. The stone is more easily broken and
cut than that of the statues, and while many crowns survive,
many more have been smashed in falling or used as building
materials.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a noteworthy fact that the images on Raraku never had
hats, nor have any of the isolated statues; they were confined
to those on the ahu.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been seen that any knowledge which exists on the island
with regard to the origin of the monuments is of the most vague
description, and it is therefore necessary, in the attempt to solve
the problem, to rely principally on indirect evidence. It becomes
in particular essential to collect all possible information about
the present people; not only for its intrinsic anthropological
interest, but in order to find if any links connect them with the
great builders, or if we must look for an earlier race.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a first step in the search the scientist naturally turns to
the most ancient accounts which he can find describing the
island, its inhabitants, and remains; these are not yet two
hundred years old. The first European to see it was a Dutch
Admiral named Roggeveen, who came upon it on Easter Day,
1722, during his search for another and mysterious island known
as Davis or David’s Island.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a> He concluded that it was not the
place for which he was looking, christened it Easter Island, and
went further afield. His ship lay off the north side of the
island for a week, but only on one day did landing take place,
and one or two of the party have left us short descriptions.
There were, they say, no big trees, but it had a rich soil and good
climate; there were sugar-cane, bananas, potatoes and figs, and
the natives brought them a number of fowls, estimated varyingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>from sixty to five hundred. One of the voyagers goes so far as
to say that “all the country was under cultivation.” As for the
inhabitants, they were, they tell us, of all shades of colour,
yellow, white, and brown, and wore clothes made of a “field
product,” evidently tapa. They were “painted,” which apparently
signifies tattooed, and it was the habit to distend the
lobes of their ears so that they hung to the shoulders, and large
discs were worn in them. “When these Indians,” wrote Roggeveen,
“go about any job which might set their ear-plugs
wagging, and bid fair to do them any hurt, they take them out
and hitch the rim of the lobe up over the top of the ear, which
gives them a quaint and laughable appearance.”<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The natives were extraordinarily thievish, stealing the caps from
the seamen’s heads, while one actually climbed into the port-hole
of the cabin and took the cloth off the table. These habits gave
rise to an unfortunate incident, as when the visitors came on
shore, a scuffle took place over the sanctity of property, and the
natives began throwing stones, on which a petty official gave the
order to fire, ten or twelve natives being killed. The occurrence,
however, was duly explained, and did not terminate amicable
relations. We learn that at this time the great statues, of which
this is of course the first report, were then, as has already been
noted, standing and in place. The Dutchmen describe them as
“remarkable, tall, stone figures, a good 30 feet in height,” and
notice that they have crowns on their heads; a clear space was,
they said, reserved round them by laying stones. They have
no doubt that the figures are objects of worship; the natives
“kindle fires in front of them, and thereafter squatting on their
heels with heads bowed down, they bring the palms of their
hands together and alternately raise and lower them.” Another
observer adds, in connection with this worship, that they “prostrated
themselves towards the rising sun.” A great step would
have been gained towards the solution of the problem if we could
feel assured that these last remarks were justified and were not
merely the result of imperfect observation.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>For fifty years darkness once more descends on the history
of the island. Then, within a period of sixteen years, it was
visited by three expeditions, Spanish, English, and French
respectively. The Spanish were under the command of Gonzalez.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
They too were searching for David’s Island when, in 1770,
they touched at Easter, and they also came to the conclusion
that it was not their goal. They took, however, formal possession
of it, and named it San Carlos. Their ships lay at anchor
in the same place as had those of Roggeveen, the bay on the
north coast now called after La Pérouse. From this anchorage
three curious hillocks on the northern slope of the great eastern
volcano form striking objects (fig. 78); on each of these they
planted a cross, and proclaimed the King of Spain with banners
flying, beating of drums, and artillery salutes. The natives
appear to have thoroughly enjoyed the proceedings, and
“confirmed them,” according to the solemn statements of the
Spaniards, by marking the official document with their own script.
This is the first that we hear of a form of native writing. The
expedition sent a boat round the island, which made a very creditable
map of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four years later Cook cast anchor on the west side in the
bay which is known by his name. He was there three days
and did not himself explore inland, but his officers did so,
including the elder Forster, the botanist of the expedition, and
his account of what they saw was published by his son.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In 1780 La Pérouse anchored in the same place, and also
sent some of his men inland, who covered partly, but not entirely,
the same districts as those of Cook.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As these expeditions were so nearly of the same date, their
remarks may fairly be compared and contrasted with those made
by Roggeveen half a century earlier. All three give very similar
descriptions of the people, their appearance and dwellings, which
also resemble the accounts of the Dutch. Cook is very much
impressed with the long ears, though La Pérouse does not refer
to them. There is the same story of the native powers of appropriating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the goods of the strangers. Cook says that they
were “as expert thieves as any we had yet met with,” and
Pérouse, whose own hat they stole while helping him down one
of the image platforms, is particularly aggrieved at such conduct,
considering that he has given them sheep, goats, pigs, and
other valuable presents; peace was only kept between the crew
and the natives by official compensation being given the seamen
for their lost property.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, however, the resemblance of these accounts with that
of Roggeveen ends. The descriptions which are given by these
later expeditions of the state of the country, and its facilities
as a port of call, are very different from those of the Dutchmen.
The Spaniards speak of it as being uncultivated save for some
small plots of ground. The Englishmen are the reverse of
enthusiastic. Forster calls it a “poor land,” and Cook says that
“no nation need contend for the honour of the discovery of this
island, as there can be few places which afford less convenience
for shipping.” “Poultry” now consists of only a “few tame
fowls”—later still we find that only one is produced. Pérouse,
although he is not so depressed as Cook, tells us that only one-tenth
of the land is cultivated. With regard to the population
Roggeveen gives no number, and probably was not in a position
to do so. The estimates made by the Spanish and English are
very similar. Gonzalez puts it at nine hundred to one thousand,
Cook at seven hundred; both of them, however, state that the
number of women seen seemed to be disproportionately small.
La Pérouse, writing of course some years later, speaks of the
number as two thousand and has seen many women and children.
Both English and French are interested to find that the language
is similar to that spoken elsewhere in the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, in dealing with the state of the monuments and the
way in which they were regarded, the impressions of the later
observers differ greatly from those of Roggeveen. The Spaniards
do not tell us very much. They saw from the sea what they
thought were bushes symmetrically put up on the beach, and
dotted about inland; later they found that they were in reality
statues, and they wondered particularly how their crowns, which
they observed were of a different material, were raised into place.
It was one of the Spanish officers who states, as recorded at the
beginning of this book, that the seashore was lined with stone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>idols,<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a> from which it may be gathered that the great majority
were still erect. The figures were, they tell us, all set up on
small stones, and burying-places were in front. It is interesting,
in view of what we know of the prohibition of smoke near the
ahu,<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> to find one of the Spanish writing: “They could not bear
us to smoke cigars; they begged our sailors to extinguish them,
and they did so. I asked one of them the reason, and he made
signs that the smoke went upwards; but I do not know what
this meant.”<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Cook’s people observed that the natives disliked
these burying-places being walked over, but whereas Roggeveen
was convinced, whether rightly or wrongly, that the cult of the
statues was what we should call “a going concern,” Cook, fifty
years later, is equally certain that it is a thing of the past; some
of the figures are still standing, but some are fallen down, and the
inhabitants “do not even trouble to repair the foundations of
those which are going to decay.” “The giant statues,” he says,
“are not in my opinion looked upon as idols by the present
inhabitants, whatever they may have been in the days of the
Dutch.” Forster also remarks that “they are so disproportionate
to the strength of the nation, it is most reasonable to
look upon them as the remains of better times.” La Pérouse
does not agree with this last sentiment; he admits that at
present the monuments are not respected, but he sees no reason
why they should not still be made even under existing conditions;
he thinks that a hundred people would be sufficient to put one
of the statues in place. The objection he sees is that the people
have no chief great enough to secure such a memorial. It is
unfortunate that the mountain of Rano Raraku is so far removed
from both the north and west anchorages, that none of the
voyagers discovered it, although Cook’s men were very near
that from which the crowns were obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>In the nineteenth century we have a few accounts from passing
voyagers. Lisiansky, in 1804, found no people with long ears,<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
but in 1825 Beechey in H.M.S. <em>Blossom</em> says that there were
still a few to be seen. With regard to the statues, the process of
demolition has gone so far that Beechey declares “the existence
of any busts is doubtful.”<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a> It is amusing to find, a hundred years
after Roggeveen’s similar experience, that the <em>Blossom</em> has an
affray with natives over the stealing of caps. While attention
has been drawn to the importance of these early narratives, it
must be remembered that all the visits were of very short duration,
and that the old voyagers were not trained observers. The
Dutchmen, for instance, deliberately tell us that the statues
have no arms. The accounts frequently give the impression of
being written up afterwards from somewhat vague recollection,
and in most cases the narrators have read those of their predecessors
and go prepared to see certain things. One navigator
who never landed assures us that the houses are the same as in
the days of La Pérouse. On the other hand, with regard to the
stores available, they are, so to speak, on their own quarter-deck,
and their remarks can be accepted without question.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the “sixties” of last century the great series of changes
took place which brought Easter Island into touch with the
modern world. The first of these largely broke those chains
with the past which the archæologist now seeks to reconstruct.
Labour was needed by the exploiters of the Peruvian guano
fields, and an attempt which was made to introduce it from
China having failed, slave-raids were organised in the South Sea
Islands. As early as 1805 Easter had suffered similarly at
the hands of American sealers, and it was amongst the principal
islands to be laid under contribution in December 1862.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is pathetic even now to hear the old men describe the
scenes which they witnessed in their youth, illustrating by action
how the raiders threw down on the ground gifts which they
thought likely to attract the inhabitants, and, when the islanders
were on their knees scrambling for them, tied their hands behind
their backs and carried them off to the waiting ship. The
natives say that one thousand in all were so removed from the
island, and, unfortunately, there were amongst them some of
the principal men, including many of the most learned, and the
last of the ariki, or chiefs. Representations were made by the
French Minister at Lima, and a certain number were put on
board ship to be returned to their home. Smallpox, however,
had been contracted by them, and out of one hundred who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>to be repatriated, only fifteen survived. These, on their return
to the island, brought the disease with them, which spread
rapidly with most fatal results to the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime, shortly before the raid, the attention of the Roman
Catholic “Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary”
in Valparaiso had been drawn to the island by the account
received from a passing ship, and they determined to inaugurate
a mission. Three of the Community left for Easter Island,
their route taking them by way of Tahiti. Finally, only one
continued, Eugène Eyraud, who landed on the island in January
1864. Eyraud was a lay brother in the Order, having been a
merchant in South America; he devoted his life to the call to
take the Gospel to Easter, and the accounts of his work, which
are extraordinarily interesting, leave a great impression of his
courage and devotion.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a> He was alone on the island for eight or
nine months, and was at the mercy of the natives, who stole his
belongings, even to the clothes he was wearing, and compelled
him to make a boat for them. In March 1866, Eyraud, after a
visit to Chile, returned with another missionary, Father Roussel,
and the two were for a while blockaded in a house which they
had put up, but the tide now turned. Either Roussel was a
man of greater determination than Eyraud, or with increased
numbers a firmer attitude was possible. Surgeon Palmer of
H.M.S. <em>Topaze</em> tells us that when one of the natives took up a
stone with a menacing gesture, Roussel quietly felled him with his
stick and went on his way, after which there was no further
trouble. The missionaries were joined later in the year by two
more of their number, and became a power in the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eyraud on his return from Chile was suffering from phthisis, of
which he died in August 1868. When he was nearing his end
he asked Roussel if there still remained any heathen in the
island, to which the Father replied “not one”; the last seven
had been baptized on the Feast of the Assumption. It seems
natural to connect with Eyraud’s illness the fact that there was
at the same time a severe epidemic of phthisis in the island; so
little was the need of precaution understood at this date, that
even Surgeon Palmer, writing of the inroads made by consumption,
remarks “which they (the natives) believe infectious.”<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>The ravages of this disease, following on those of smallpox,
reduced the population, which at the time of the arrival of the
mission had stood at twelve hundred, by about one-fourth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The remarks of the missionaries on native customs, particularly
those dealing with their ceremonies, reflect credit on the observers
at a time when such things were too often thought
beneath notice; they will be referred to later. Their ethnological
work was, however, limited by more pressing exigencies, by the
difficulties of locomotion on the island, and by the language.
Roussel compiled a vocabulary, which is useful to students,
though not free from the mode of thought found in a well-known
missionary dictionary, which translates hansom cab into the
Swahili language. It is a curious fact that so completely
were the terraces now ruined that the Fathers never allude to
the statues, and seem scarcely to have realised their existence;
but it is through them that we first hear of the wooden tablets
carved with figures. The body of professors acquainted with
this art of writing perished, either in Peru or by epidemic, and
this, in connection with the introduction of Christianity, led to
great destruction of the existing specimens of this most interesting
script. The natives said that they burnt the tablets in
compliance with the orders of the missionaries, though such suggestion
would hardly be needed in a country where wood is scarce;
the Fathers, on the contrary, state that it was due to them that
any were preserved. Some certainly were saved by their means
and through the interest shown in them by Bishop Jaussen of
Tahiti, while two or three found their way to museums after the
natives became aware of their value; but some or all of these
existing tablets are merely fragments of the original. The
natives told us that an expert living on the south coast, whose
house had been full of such glyphs, abandoned them at the call
of the missionaries, on which a man named Niari, being of a
practical mind, got hold of the discarded tablets and made a
boat of them wherein he caught much fish. When the “sewing
came out,” he stowed the wood into a cave at an ahu near Hanga
Roa, to be made later into a new vessel there. Pakarati, an
islander now living, found a piece, and it was acquired by the
U.S.A. ship <em>Mohican</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Side by side with the establishment of the religious power the
secular had come into being. The master of the ship who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>brought the last two missionaries was a certain Captain Dutrou
Bornier. He had been attracted by the place, and, having made
financial arrangements with the mercantile house of Brander in
Tahiti, settled himself on the island and proceeded to exploit
it commercially. Title-deeds were obtained from the natives in
exchange for gifts of woven material. The remaining population
was gathered together into one settlement at Hanga Roa, the
native name for the shore of Cook’s Bay. This was the state
of things when H.M.S. <em>Topaze</em> touched in 1868 and carried off
the two statues now at the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dutrou Bornier had at first spoken enthusiastically of the
work of the missionaries; later, however, the not unknown struggle
arose between the religious and secular powers. According to
the accounts of the missionaries, they protested against the
actions of Bornier in taking over two hundred natives, practically
by force, and shipping them to Tahiti to work on the Brander
plantations. Bornier retaliated by rendering their position
impossible, and the Fathers ultimately received orders to transfer
their labours to the Gambier islands. Jaussen tells us that their
converts desired to accompany them, and that almost the whole
population went on board with them. The captain, however,
instigated by Bornier, refused to carry so many, and one hundred
and seventy-five were sent back to the shore. This, therefore,
“was the whole population” in 1871. We have not Bornier’s
account of the quarrel, but there seems to have been some
justification for the attitude of the missionaries towards him, as
five years later he was murdered by the natives, and, if current
stories are to be believed, his end was well merited.</p>

<p class='c007'>Subsequently one of the Branders lived at Mataveri, and
Mr. Alexander Salmon, to whom the missionaries sold their
interests, at Vaihu on the south coast.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a> The Salmon family
had intermarried with the royal family of Tahiti, and the new
resident was well aware of the value of antiquities. According to
native accounts he organised a band to search the caves and
hiding-places for articles of interest. They also state that he
employed skilled natives to produce wooden objects connected
with their older culture for sale to passing ships. He spoke the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>language of the island, and when the U.S.S. <em>Mohican</em> arrived
in 1886, he was the source of much of the information which they
subsequently published. It is an important but difficult matter
to know how far the material thus gleaned thirty years ago was
carefully obtained and reproduced. One or two of the folk-tales
are still told very much as retailed by Salmon, but he appears to
have taken little interest in the surviving customs and failed
to understand them. The report of the <em>Mohican</em>, made by Paymaster
Thomson, has been the only account of the island in
existence with any pretention to scientific value.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a> The <em>Mohican</em>
was there eleven days, and Thomson went rapidly round the island
with a party from the ship. The amount of ground covered and
work done is remarkable, although his statements are naturally
not free from the errors inseparable from such rapid observation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1888 the Chilean Government formally took possession.
In 1897 M. Merlet, of Valparaiso, purchased from the representatives
of Brander, Bornier, and Salmon, their interest in Easter
Island, with the exception of a tract of land containing the
village of Hanga Roa, which the Chilean Government acquired
from the missionaries and retained in the interest of the inhabitants;
this land covers a far larger space than the natives are
able to utilise. The population is again increasing, as will have
been seen from the fact that during our visit they numbered two
hundred and fifty. M. Merlet subsequently sold his holding to
a company, of which he became chairman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Easter Island has had many names. That given by the Dutchman
has become generally accepted, but the Spaniards christened
it San Carlos, and in some maps it is termed “Waihu,” a name
of a part of the island erroneously understood as applying to the
whole. A native name is Te Pito-te-henua, “<em>henua</em>” means
usually “earth” and “<em>pito</em>” “navel.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Thomson says it was
ascribed to the first comers. Elsewhere in the Pacific “<em>pito</em>”
also means “end.” Churchill holds the name signified simply
“Land’s End,” and was applied to all these angles of the island,
which was itself without a name.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Rapa-nui (or Great Rapa) is
another native name for which various explanations are offered.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>The island of Rapa, sometimes known as Rapa-iti, lies some
two thousand miles to the westward, Thomson states that
the name Rapa-nui only dates from the time when the men
kidnapped by the Peruvians were being returned to their
homes. The Easter Islanders, finding no one knew the name
Te Pito-te-henua, and that some comrades in distress from the
other Rapa managed to make their place of origin understood,
called their own home Rapa-nui; a story which sounds hardly
probable, but was presumably obtained from Salmon.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the report of H.M.S. <em>Topaze</em>, the Islanders of
their day believed that Rapa was their original home. Others
state the name was given by a visitor from that island.</p>

<p class='c006'>The brief accounts which have been referred to are all that
is known from external evidence of the original life of the
present people, and but little hope was held out to us in England
that those fragments could still be supplemented. There were
found, however, to be still in existence two possible sources of
information, namely, the memories of old inhabitants, and the
actual traces which still remain of the life led by the people
previous to the Peruvian raid and the coming of Christianity.
The great ahu which have so far been described are only a part,
although the most imposing portion, of the stone remains of the
island. It is fortunate for the student that when civilisation
appeared the natives were gathered into one settlement, for they
left behind them, sprinkled over the island, various erections
connected with their original domestic life. These buildings
were certainly being used in recent times, and are treated from
this point of view, but for all we know they may have been, and
very possibly were, contemporary with the great works.</p>

<p class='c007'>The study of the remains on the island, from the greatest to
the least, is by no means so simple as may hitherto have appeared.
Our earliest attempts at descriptions, although conscientious,
were almost ludicrous in the light of subsequent knowledge,
and Captain Beechey’s error on the subject of “the busts” is at
least comprehensible. Easter, it must be remembered, is a
mass of disintegrating rocks. When in an idle moment the
Expedition amused itself by inventing an heraldic design for the
island, it was universally agreed that the main emblem must
undoubtedly be a “stone,” “and as supporters,” suggested one
frivolous member, “two cockroaches rampant.” The most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>correct representation would be a stone vertical on a stone
horizontal. Every individual who has lived, even temporarily,
in the place, has collected stones and put them up according
to taste; and every succeeding generation, also needing stones,
has, as in the instance of the manager’s wall, found them most
readily in ruining or converting the work of their predecessors.
Even when a building is comparatively intact, the original
design and purpose can only be grasped by experience, and
matters become distinctly complicated when the walls of an ahu
have been made into a garden enclosure and a chicken-house
turned into an ossuary. It must be remembered also that rough
stone buildings bear in themselves no marks of age. The cairns
put up by us to mark the distances for rifle fire from the camp
were indistinguishable from those of prehistoric nature made
for a very different purpose. The result is that the tumble-down
remains of yesterday, and the scenes of unknown antiquity
blend together in a confusing whole in which it is not always
easy to distinguish even the works of nature from those of man.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other source of information which was open to us was the
memory of the old people. If but little was known of the great
works, it was possible that there might still linger knowledge of
customs or folk lore which would throw indirect light on origins.
This field proved to be astonishingly large, but it was even more
difficult to collect facts from brains than out of stones. On our
arrival there were still a few old people who were sufficiently
grown up in the sixties to recall something of the old life; with
the great majority of these, about a dozen in number, we gradually
got in touch, beginning with those who worked for Mr.
Edmunds and hearing from them of others. It was momentous
work, for the eleventh hour was striking, day by day they were
dropping off; it was a matter of anxious consideration whose
testimony should first be recorded for fear that, meanwhile,
others should be gathered to their fathers, and their store of
knowledge lost for ever. Against the longer recollection of
extreme old age, had to be put the fact that the memories of
those a little younger were generally more clear and accurate.
The feeling of responsibility from a scientific point of view was
very great. Ten years ago more could have been done; ten years
hence little or nothing will remain of this source of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Most happily, these authorities were in almost every case
willing and ready to talk, and our debt to them is great. They
came with us, as has been seen, on our explorations of the island,
but the greater part of the work was done when we were living
near the village. Some of them took pleasure in coming up to
Mataveri and talking in the veranda, enjoying still more, no
doubt, the practical outcome of their subsequent visits to Bailey’s
domain—the kitchen. Others were more at ease in their own
surroundings, and then we went down to the village and discussed
old days in their little banana-plots, while interested
neighbours came in to join the fray. Sometimes a man did
better by himself, but on other occasions to get two or three
together stimulated conversation. Unfortunately, some of the
old men who knew most were confined to the leper settlement
some three miles north of Hanga Roa, and the infectious power
of leprosy was not a subject which we had got up before leaving
England. The Captain of the <em>Kildalton</em> feared lest even the
distance of the settlement from the Manager’s house might not
suffice to prevent the plague being carried there by insects, and
told a gruesome tale, within his knowledge, of two white men who
had gone for a visit to a Pacific island, one of whom on their
return to an American port had been immediately sent back
to a leper colony. But how could one allow the last vestige of
knowledge in Easter Island to die out without an effort? So
I went, disinfected my clothes on return, studied, must it be
confessed, my fingers and toes, and hoped for the best.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would not be easy for a foreigner to reconstruct English
society fifty years ago, even from the descriptions of well-educated
old men: it is particularly difficult to arrive at the truth
from the untutored mind. Even when the natives knew well
what they were talking about, they would forget to mention some
part of the story, which to them was self-evident, but at which
the humble European could not be expected to guess. The
bird story, for example, had for many months been wrestled with
before it transpired precisely what was meant by the “first egg.”
Deliberate invention was rare, but, when memory was a little
vague, there was a constant tendency to glide from what was
remembered to what was imagined. Scientific work of this
nature really ought to qualify for a high position at the bar. The
witness had to be heard, and discreetly cross-examined without
any doubt being thrown on his story, which would at once have
given offence; then allowed to forget and again re-examined, his
story being compared with that of others who had been heard
meanwhile. Counsel had also to be judge and to act as reporter,
and at the same time keep the witness amused and prevent the
interpreter from being bored, or the court would promptly have
broken up. Though great care has been exercised, it must be
remembered, when a particular account is quoted, as, for example,
that of Te Haha regarding the annual inspection of the tablets,
while it is believed to rest on fact, its absolute accuracy cannot
be guaranteed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>The language question naturally added to the difficulty. On
landing two courses had been open, either to go on with Spanish,
of which the younger men had a certain knowledge, and which
was used by Mr. Edmunds, or to try to get some hold of the
native tongue. The latter plan was decided on, and though
at one time the difficulties seemed so great that this course was
almost regretted, in the end it was vindicated. There is, as
stated, a vocabulary in French made by the missionaries, and
also one in Spanish, but there is no grammar of any kind.
The French carpenter, Varta, was some assistance, particularly
at the beginning. The first steps were the easiest. The Kanakas
were much interested in my endeavours, and rushed round wildly,
bringing any object they could lay hands on in order to teach
its name; but even with the nouns an unexpected complication
arose. The natives speak, not only their own language, but,
side by side with it, that of Tahiti, which is used in their religious
books and services; there are affinities between the two, but
they are quite dissimilar, and to understand conversation it
was necessary to learn both. This very much prolonged the
task, and also lessened the results obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next stage, the putting together of sentences, was still
more difficult. How was it possible to talk in a language
which had no verb “to be”? I had, it is true, a native maid
(fig. 29), but, after the simplest phrases had been learnt, topics
for conversation were difficult to find. We looked through
illustrated magazines together, but wild beasts, railway trains,
and the greater part of the pictures of all kinds, conveyed
nothing to her. The plan was therefore hit on of a tale, after
the manner of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, dealing with imaginary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>events on the island; it was very weird, but served its purpose,
though there were initial difficulties. The heroine, for instance,
was christened “Maria,” but “there were,” Parapina said,
“three Marias on the island. Which was it?” and it was long
before she grasped, if indeed she ever did so entirely, that the
lady was imaginary. A certain sequence of events was somehow
made intelligible to her. She was then induced to repeat the
story, while it was taken down. It was copied out and next
day read again to her for further correction. Every word and
idea gained was a help in understanding local names and the
native point of view. Before the end, in addition to using
the language for the ordinary affairs of life, it was found
possible to get simple answers direct from the old men, and
understand first-hand much of what they said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any real success in intercourse was, however, due to the
intelligence of one individual who was known as Juan Tepano.
He was a younger man about forty years of age, a full-blooded
Kanaka, but had served his time in the Chilean army, and thus
had seen something of men and manners; he talked a little
pidgin English, which was a help in the earlier stages, but
before the end he and I were able to understand each other
entirely in Kanaka, and he made clear to the old men anything
I wished to know, and explained their answers to me. It was
interesting to notice how his perception gradually grew of what
truth and accuracy meant, and he finally assumed the attitude
of watch-dog to prevent my being imposed on. Happily, it was
discovered that he was able to draw, and he took great delight
in this new-found power, which proved most useful. The tattoo
designs were obtained, for example, by giving him a large sheet
of paper with an outline of a man or woman, also a pencil and
piece of candle; these he took down to the village, gathered the
old men together in their huts in the evening, and brought up
in the morning the figure adorned by the direction of the ancients
(fig. 88). He took a real interest in the work, learning through
the conversations much about the place which was new to him,
and at the end of the time triumphantly stated, “Mam-ma now
knows everything there is to know about the island.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>It is proposed to unite the information gained from locality
and memory, referring where necessary to the accounts of the
early voyagers, and give as complete descriptions as possible
of the primitive existence which continued on Easter Island till
the middle of last century. It will be seen that the condition
of the people on the coming of Christianity, as we were able to
ascertain it, corresponded almost exactly with that described
by the first visitors from Europe, more than a hundred years
earlier. Such traditions as linger regarding the megalithic
remains have already been alluded to earlier in this book, but
attention will be drawn to the point whenever this line of
research seems successful in throwing indirect light on the
origin of the great works.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Mode of Life.</em>—The present natives, in talking of old times,
say that their ancestors were “as thick as grass,” and stood
up like the fingers of two hands with the palms together; a
statement from which deduction must be made for pictorial
representation. The early mariners never, as we have seen,
estimate the population at more than two thousand, but the
land could carry many more. Mr. Edmunds calculates that
about half of the total amount (or some 15,000 acres) could
grow bananas and sweet potatoes. Two acres of cultivated
ground would be sufficient to supply an ordinary family.</p>

<p class='c007'>Housing accommodation presented no great problem. Many
slept in the open, and even to-day, in the era of Christianity
and European clothes, a cave is looked upon as sufficient
shelter. When on moving from our “town” to our “country”
house we inquired where our attendants were to sleep, we were
cheerfully informed “it was all right, there was a very good cave
near Tongariki”—and this cave, called Ana Havea, became a
permanent annexe to the establishment (fig. 124). Some of these
caves had a wall built in front for shelter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Houses, however, did exist, which were built in the form of
a long upturned canoe; they were made of sticks, the tops
of which were tied together, the whole being thatched successively
with reeds, grass, and sugar-cane. In the best of
these houses, the foundations, which are equivalent to the
gunwale of the boat, are made of wrought stones let into
the ground; they resemble the curbstones of a street pavement
save that the length is greater. In the top of the stones were
holes from which sprang the curved rods, which were equivalent to
the ribs of a boat, and formed the walls and roof (figs. 84 and 85).
The end stones of the house are carefully worked on the curve,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>and it is very rare to find them still in place, as they were comparatively
light, weighing from one to two hundredweight, and
easily carried off. Even the heavier stones were at times seized
upon as booty in enemy raids; one measuring 15 feet was
pointed out to us near an ahu on the south coast, which had been
brought all the way from the north side of the island. In the
middle of one side of the house was a doorway, and in the front
of it a porch, which had also stone foundations. The whole
space in front of the house was neatly paved with water-worn
boulders, in the same manner as the ahu. This served as a stoep
on which to sit and talk, but its practical utility was obvious to
ourselves in the rainy seasons, when the entrance to our tents
and houses became deep in mud (fig. 84<span class='fss'>A</span>). Near the main abode
was a thatched house which contained the native oven, the stones
of which are often still in place. The cooking was done Polynesian
fashion: a hole about 15 inches deep is lined with flat stones, a
fire is made within, and, when the stones are sufficiently heated,
the food, wrapped up in parcels, is stacked within and covered
with earth, a fire being lighted on the top.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the surviving old people were born and brought up in
these houses, which are known as “haré paenga.” The old
man, for example, before alluded to, who was brought out to
Raraku, roved round the mountain telling with excitement who
occupied the different houses in the days of his youth. He
gave a particularly graphic description of the scene after sundown,
when all were gathered within for the evening meal.
In addition to the main door, there was, he said, an opening
near each end by which the food was passed in and then from
hand to hand; as perfect darkness reigned, a sharp watch
had to be kept that it all reached its proper owners. He lay
down within the old foundations to show how the inhabitants
slept. This was parallel to the long axis of the house, the head
being towards the door; the old people were in the centre in
couples, and the younger ones in the ends. The largest of
these houses, which had some unique features, measured 122 feet
in length, with an extreme width of 12 feet; but some 50 feet
by 5 feet or 6 feet are more usual measurements. They were
often shared by related families and held anything from ten to
thirty, or even more, persons.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>The food consisted of the usual tropical produce, such as
potatoes, bananas, sugar-cane, and taro. Animal diet formed a
very small part of it, rats being the only form of mammal; but
chickens played an important rôle in native life, and the remains
of the dwellings made for them are much more imposing than
those for human beings. They are solid cairns, in the centre of
which was a chamber, running the greater part of their length;
it was entered from outside by two or more narrow tunnels, down
which the chickens could pass. They were placed here at night
for the sake of safety, as it was impossible to remove the stones
in the dark without making a noise (fig. 86). Fish are not very
plentiful, as there is no barrier reef, but they also were an article
of diet, and were bartered by those on the coast for the vegetable
products obtained by those further inland. Fish-hooks made of
stone were formerly used, and a legend tells of a man who had
marvellous success because he used one made of human bone.
The heroes of the tales are also spoken of as fishing with nets.
There are in various places on the coast round towers, built of
stone, which are said to have been look-out towers whence
watchers on land communicated the whereabouts of the fish to
those at sea; these contained a small chamber below which was
used as a sleeping apartment (fig. 87). Turtles appear on the
carvings on the rock, and are alluded to in legend, and turtle-shell
ornaments were worn; but the water is too cold for them
ever to have been common, and Anakena is almost the only
sandy bay where they could have come on shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sole form of dress was the cloth made from the paper
mulberry, and known throughout the South Seas as tapa; it
was used for loin-cloths and wraps, which the Spaniards describe
as fastening over one shoulder. Head-gear was a very important
point, as witnessed by the way the islanders always stole the
caps of the various European sailors. The natives had various
forms of crowns made of feathers, some of them reserved for
special occasions. Cherished feathers, particularly those of
white cocks, were brought out of gourds, where they had been
carefully kept, to manufacture specimens for the Expedition.
The crowns are generally made to form a shade over the eyes,
like the head-dresses of the images. Naturally, every effort was
made to find the prototype of the image hats. No one recollected
ever seeing anything precisely like it, but among the pictures
drawn for us of various head-decorations was a cylindrical hat
made of grass; the brim projected all the way round as with a
European hat, but it had the same form of knot on the top as
that of the statues.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tattooing was a universal practice, and the exactness of the
designs excited the admiration of the early voyagers, who wondered
how savages managed to achieve such regularity and
accuracy. The drawings made for us from the descriptions of
the old people show the men covered, not only with geometrical
designs, but with pictures of every-day objects, such as chisels and
fish-hooks; even houses, boats, and chickens were represented in
this way according to taste. The most striking objects were
drawings of heads, one on each side of the body, known as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“paré-pu,” which the old mariners describe as “fearsome
monstrosities”<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> (fig. 88). Various old persons said that they
remembered seeing men with a pattern on the back similar to the
rings and girdle of the images. It seems, however, doubtful
whether the image design merely represented tattoo, in view of
the fact that it was raised, not incised, and in any case this would
only put the search for its prototype a stage further back.
The fact, however, remains that those particular marks were
still being perpetuated, and form a link connecting the present
with the past. Beechey, in 1825, tells us the women were so
tattooed as to look as if they wore breeches. In addition to this
kind of decoration, the islanders adorned themselves with various
colours: white and red were obtained from mineral products
found in certain places; yellow from a plant known as “pua,”<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
and black from ashes of sugar-cane. They had a distinct feeling
for art. Some of the paintings found in caves and houses are
obviously recent, and it is a frequent answer to questions as to
the why and wherefore of things, that they were to make some
object “look nice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that not only have the images long ears,
but that all the early voyagers speak of them as general among
the inhabitants. It was therefore somewhat surprising to find
that no such thing was known as a man whose ears had been
perforated, though with the women the custom went on till the
introduction of Christianity, and two or three females with the
lobe dilated in this manner still survived (fig. 90). At last one
old leper recalled that the father of his foster-father had long
ears, and on asking as a child for the reason, he had received the
illuminating reply that “the old people had them like that.”
He also mentioned one or two others with similar ears, and this
was subsequently confirmed by other authorities. It will be
seen that the custom, as far as men were concerned, of dilating
the lobe of the ear, must have been abandoned at the end of the
eighteenth century, or just about the time of the visits of the
Spanish, English, and French Expeditions. That this was cause
and effect, and that they imitated the appearance of the foreign
sailors, seems more than a guess; it will appear from other
sources how great was the impression which was made by the
foreigners.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span><em>Social Life.</em>—Roggeveen’s description of the people as being
of all shades of colour is still accurate. They themselves are
very conscious of the variations, and when we were collecting
genealogies, they were quite ready to give the colour of even
remote relations: “Great-aunt Susan,” it would be unhesitatingly
stated, was “white,” and “Great-aunt Jemima black.” The
last real ariki, or chief, was said to be quite white. “White like
me?” I innocently asked. “You!” they said, “you are red”;
the colour in European cheeks, as opposed to the sallow white
to which they are accustomed, is to the native our most distinguishing
mark. It is obvious that we are dealing with a
mixed race, but this only takes us part of the way, as the mixture
may have taken place either before or after they reached the
island.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were divided into ten groups, or clans (“máta”), which
were associated with different parts of the island, though the
boundaries blend and overlap; members of one division settled
not infrequently among those of another. Each person still
knows his own clan.</p>

<p class='c007'>In remembered times there were no group restrictions on
marriage, which took place indiscriminately between members
of the same or of different clans. The only prohibition had
reference to consanguinity, and forbade all union nearer than
the eighth degree or third cousins. These ten clans were again
grouped, more especially in legend or speaking of the remote
past, into two major divisions known as Kotuu (or Otuu), and
Hotu Iti, which correspond roughly with the western and eastern
parts of the island. These divisions were also known respectively
as Mata-nui, or greater clans, and Mata-iti, or lesser clans. The
lower portions of the island were the most densely populated
parts, especially those on the coast, and the settlements on the
higher ground appear to have been few (fig. 91).</p>

<p class='c007'>In Kotuu, the Marama and Haumoana inhabited side by side
the land running from sea to sea between the high central ground
and the western volcano Rano Kao. They had a small neighbour,
the Ngatimo, to the south, and jointly with the Miru
spread over Rano Kao and formed settlements by the margin
of the crater lake. The Miru lived on the high, narrow strip
between the mountain in the apex and the cliff, and mixed up
with them was a lesser people, the Hamea. To the east was
another small clan, the Raa, which is spoken of in conjunction
with the Miru and Hamea.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>The principal Hotu Iti clans were the Tupahotu, the Koró-orongo,
and the Hitiuira. The last were generally known as the
“Ureohei”; they inhabited jointly the level piece of ground from
the northern bay to the south coast, and had some dwellings on
the eastern headland. Next to them on the south coast was a
small group, the Ngaure.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a> The particular importance of the clans
lies in the fact that, while they may be merely groups of one
body, they may, on the other hand, represent different races or
waves of immigrants. If there have been two peoples on Easter
Island, these divisions are one place where we must at least look
for traces for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Legend tells of continual wars between Hotu Iti and Kotuu.
In recent times general fighting seems to have been constant,
and took place even between members of one clan. A wooden
sword, or paoa, was used, but the chief weapon was made from
obsidian, and took from it the name of “mataa.” This volcanic
glass is found on the slope of Rano Kao, but the principal quarries
are on the neighbouring hill of Orito. Tradition says its use was
first discovered by a boy who stepped on it and cut his foot.
The obsidian was knapped till it had a cutting edge, and also a
tongue, which latter was fitted into a handle or stick (fig. 92).
The various shapes assumed were dignified by names, fourteen
of which were given, such as “tail of a fish,” “backbone of a
rat,” “leaf of a banana.” It was very usual to pick up these
mataa, and hoards were occasionally found; in one instance fifty
or sixty were discovered below a stone in a cave, and in another
case the hammer-stone was found with them which had been
used in the process of squeezing off the flakes. The weapon was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>used both as a spear and as a javelin. A site is pointed out near
Anakena, where a man throwing down hill killed another at about
thirty-five yards. The art of making these mataa is, of course,
practically extinct, but one old man, commonly known as “Hé”
(fig. 83), brought us some which he had manufactured himself
for the Expedition, and which were fairly well wrought.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the exception of the Miru, of which more will be said,
there were no chiefs nor any form of government; any man who
was expert in war became a leader. The warfare consisted
largely of spasmodic and isolated raids; an aggrieved person
gathered together his neighbours and descended on the offenders.
It is related incidentally that one man, going along the south
coast, “found war going on,” one set of men having blocked
up another in a cave. Another story is told of six men, called
Gwaruti-mata-keva, of the clan Tupahotu, who lived in a cave
in a certain hillock on the south coast, known as Toa-toa. They
went round in a boat to Hanga Piko, stole fish, and returned
rapidly to their cave. A hundred men from Hanga Piko then
came overland to punish the robbery, and made a fire of grass
before the cave in which the men lay hidden. When the attackers
assumed that the enemy were all dead from suffocation,
they went into the cave; but those within had buried their
faces in holes scraped in the earth, and when the men from
Hanga Piko entered, they arose and slew the whole hundred.
A more interesting fact came out incidentally in connection with
this gang of Toa-toa, connecting them with the secret societies
found elsewhere in the Pacific. They were, it was said, in the
habit of going about after dark with their faces painted red,
white, and black, and visiting houses, where they declared they
were gods, and demanded food, which the inhabitants accordingly
gave them. The fraud, however, finally came to light when one
day a man, who was travelling with his servant, saw them washing
paint off their faces, “so they knew that they had deceived the
people, and the people gathered together and killed them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In these internecine fights fire was very generally set to the
enemy’s dwellings. “He often burnt houses,” a young man
said, pointing to an older one, and the impeachment was not
denied. The ahu, too, were raided and bodies burnt, which
seems to be the cause of the burnt bones recorded by certain
travellers; there is no reason to suppose there was cremation
or sacrifice on Easter Island. It was in this sort of warfare that
the last images were overthrown.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>While legends record how many people were eaten after each
affray, all living persons deny, with rather striking unanimity,
not only that they themselves have ever been cannibals, but that
their fathers were so. If this is correct, the custom was dying out
for some reason before the advent of Christianity;<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a> their grandfathers,
the old people admit, ate human flesh, but, if there were
any rites connected with it, they “did not tell.” The great-grandmother
of an old man of the Miru clan was, according to
his account, killed on the high central part of the island by the
Ureohei and eaten. In revenge for the outrage, one of her sons,
Hotu by name, killed sixty of the Ureohei. Another son, who
had pacifist leanings, thought the feud ought then to be ended,
but Hotu desired yet more victims, and there was a violent
quarrel between the two brothers, in which the peace-maker was
struck on the head with a club; for, as Hotu remarked, if
they had slain his father, it would have been different, but really
to eat his mother was “no good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Our acquaintance with the person said to have been “the
last cannibal,” or rather with his remains, came about accidentally
during the time when I was alone on the island. A little
party of us had ridden to the top of the volcano Rano Kao;
and on the southern side of the crater, that opposite Orongo,
some of the natives were pointing out the legendary sites connected
with the death of the first immigrant chief, Hotu-matua.
Suddenly one of them vanished into a crevice in the rocks, and
reappeared brandishing a thigh-bone to call attention to its
large size. I dismounted, scrambled into a little grotto, or
natural cave, where a skeleton was extended; the skull was
missing, but the jaw-bone was present, and the rest of the bones
were in regular order; the individual had either died there or been
buried. Bones were in the department of the absent member
of the Expedition, but it was of course essential to collect them,
from the view of determining race, and the natives never resented
our doing so. I therefore passed these out, packed them in grass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>in the luncheon-basket, and, sitting down on a rock, asked to be
told the story of the cave. “That,” my attendants replied, “is
Ko Tori.” He was, they said, the last man on the island who
had eaten human flesh. In this hiding-place he had enjoyed his
meals, and no one had ever been able to track him. There had
formerly been a cooking-place, but it was now hidden by a fall
of stones. He had died as a very old man at the other end
of the island, apparently in the odour of sanctity; to judge
by the toothless jaw if he had not deserted his sins they
must long ago have deserted him. His last desire was to be
buried in the place with which he had such pleasant connections,
and in dutiful regard to his wishes, or because it was feared that
his ghost might otherwise make itself unpleasant, some of the
young men bore the corpse on stretchers along the south coast
and up to the top of the mountain, depositing it here. The next
thing was to get at some sort of date; chronology is naturally
of a vague order, and the most effective method is, if possible,
to connect events with the generation in which they happened.
“Did your grandfather know him,” was asked, “or your
father?” The answer was unexpected. “Porotu,” they said,
pointing to one of the old men, “helped to carry him,” and
silence fell on the group. My heart sank; I had then undone
this last pious work and committed sacrilege. To my great
relief, however, strange sounds soon made it clear that the
humorous side had appealed to the escort; they were suffocating
with mirth. “And now,” they said, gasping between sobs of
laughter, “Ko Tori goes in a basket to England.” As I write,
Ko Tori resides at the Royal College of Surgeons, and has done
his bit towards elucidating the mystery of Easter Island.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sexual morality, as known to us, was not a strong point
in life on the island, but marriage was distinctly recognised, and
the absolute loose liver was a person apart. Polygamy was
usual, but many seem to have had only one wife. The children
belonged to the father’s clan, and are often distinguished by his
name being given after their own. At the same time the clan
of the mother was not ignored, and a man would sometimes fight
for his maternal side. If a man had sons by more than one wife,
after his death each claimed the body of his father to lie on the
ahu of his mother’s clan, and the corpse might thus be carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to several in turn, finally returning to its own destination. We
collected a certain number of genealogical trees, the various
dramatis personæ being for this purpose represented by matches
or buttons. It was not a very popular line of research, the cry
being apt to be raised, “Now let’s talk of something interesting”;
but some two hundred names were in this way placed in their
family groups, with details of clan, place of residence and colour,
and some knowledge obtained with regard to many more. It
is not of course enough ground on which to found any theory,
but it was very useful in checking information gathered in other
ways. Only in one case was it possible to get back beyond the
great-grandfather of our informant, but the knowledge of family
connections was often greater than would be found among Europeans.
The number of childless marriages was striking.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early story of Viriamo (fig. 83), the oldest woman living
in our day, gives a picture of this primitive state of things. She
belonged to the clan of Ureohei, and her family had lived for
some generations, as far back as could be remembered, on the
edge of the eastern volcano, not far from Raraku. The great-grandfather,
who was dark, had as his only wife a white woman
of the Hamea. Their son was white, and had two wives, one of
the Tupahotu and one of the Ngaure. By the first, although she
also was white, he had a dark son who married a white wife of
his own clan, Ureohei, but of a different group. Viriamo was
the second of their eight children, all of whom were white save
herself and her eldest brother. Four of the girls died young
in the epidemic of smallpox in 1864. Viriamo and two of her
sisters were initiated as children into the bird rite.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a> When older
she was tattooed with rings round her forehead and with the
dark-blue breeches. Somewhat later, but still as a young
woman, she went over to Anakena and had her ears pierced, but
she never had the lobe extended, preferring to let it remain small.
When asked about her marriage, she bridled as coyly as a young
girl. Her first union was a matter of arrangement, the husband,
who was also of the Ureohei, giving her father much food, and, if
she had refused to accept the situation, she would, she said, have
been beaten. There was no ceremony of any kind, no new
clothes nor feasting; her father simply took her to her new home
and handed her over. The house was near the two statues with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the projecting noses, excavated on the south-eastern slope of
Raraku (fig. 73), and, when she wanted water, rather than cross
the boundary and go round to the lake by the gap, through the
hostile dwellers on the western side, she used to clamber with
her vessel up the boundary rift in the cliff-face. There was one
white child, who died young, but her marriage was not a success,
and Viriamo left the man and went off to live with one of the
Miru clan at Anakena. His house already contained a wife and
family, also four brothers, but they all got on quite happily together.
She had five children by this man, who, like their father,
were all white; four of them, however, died in infancy. This was
the result of the parents having most unfortunately fallen foul
of an old man, whose cloak had been taken without his consent,
and who had accordingly prophesied disaster. The remaining
child, a daughter, was living and unmarried when we were on
the island. The last husband was the most satisfactory of the
three; he was a Tupahotu living near Tongariki. She was
handed over to him as a matter of family arrangement, in discharge
of a debt, but she was quite amenable to the exchange,
and was very fond of him. He was light in colour, but her only
child by this marriage, our friend Juan, was dark, taking, as he
said, “after my mam-ma.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The women do not seem, judging by existing remains, to have
had always a happy time. Dr. Keith, who examined the skulls
collected by the Expedition, concludes his report on one of the
female specimens as follows: “The most likely explanation is
that the indent of the left temple was the cause of death, produced
by the blow of a club, and that the suppuration and
repair of the right side has been also produced by a former blow
which failed to prove fatal. Two other skulls, also those of
women, show indented fractures in the left temporal region.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Any deficiency at marriages, in the way of social festivity, was
made up at funerals. These were attended by persons from
all over the island, for “when they were not fighting, they were
all cousins.” In answer to the remark that “considering the
population their whole time must have gone in this way,” it was
cheerfully observed that “they had nothing else to do, so they
all went, everybody took food and everybody ate.” The parents
of one of our friends, Kapiera, lived at Anakena, but he was
born on the south side of the island near Vaihu “when his
mother went for a funeral.” The men who knew the tablets
went also and sang, but there seems to have been little or nothing
in the way of rites. The missionaries were impressed with the
fact that there was no ceremony of any kind at a burial.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Most elaborate spells were, however, performed in connection
with a man who had been slain, known as “tangata ika,” or
fish-man; the corpse was kept from resting either day or night
while his neighbours went in pursuit of vengeance. In front of
one ahu, on the north coast, some pieces of the old statues have
been formed into a rude chair. On this, it was said, had been
seated the naked body of a man belonging to the district, Kota-vari-vari
by name, who had been killed at Akahanga on the
south coast. One man kept the corpse from falling, while two
others sat behind and chanted songs to aid the avengers. These
watchers were covered with black ashes, wore only feather hats,
and carried the small dancing-paddle known as “rapa” (fig. 116);
the chief man in charge of the ceremony was known as the
“timo.” It must have been an eerie scene as dusk came on.
The story is told of a murder near Tongariki. In this case the
victim’s corpse was placed on the ahu and turned over at intervals
by the watchers. Hanga Maihiko, a converted image ahu on
the south coast, is one of those which have a paved approach, and
there are on the pavement two stones—pieces of a hat and a
statue—specially used for exposing “fish-men” (fig. 93). If these
charms failed to act, there was a still more reliable way. The
clothes of the victim were buried beneath the cooking-place of
the foe, and when he had partaken of food prepared there he
would certainly die the night following. Some of the carved
tablets were connected with these rites; one was certainly known
as that of the “Ika,” while there is said to have been another
called “Timo,” which was the “list” kept by each ahu of its
murdered men.</p>

<p class='c007'>The custom of exposing the dead was, as has been stated,
going on in living memory. The information already given on
this head is confirmed by the accounts of the missionaries,<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>burial was also practised, the mode of disposal being a matter
of choice. There were two drawbacks to exposure: firstly, if
the deceased was for any reason an uncanny person, his ghost
might make itself unpleasant—he was safer hidden under stones;
secondly, the body, if left in the open, might be burnt by
enemies; this latter was the reason given for the burial of the
last great chief, Ngaara, who was interred in one of the image
ahu on the western coast. Not only were the ruins of the greater
ahu still being used, but up till 1863 smaller ones were being
built. One was pointed out on the north coast as having been
put up for an individual, the maternal aunt of our guide, the
lady having had the misfortune to be killed by a devil in the
night. It was a small structure, ovoidal in shape, 10 feet in
length, with a flat top sloping from a height of 9 feet at the end
towards the sea, to 4 feet 6 inches at that towards the land; there
was beneath it a vaulted chamber for bones.</p>

<p>FIG. 94.—DIAGRAM OF AHU POE-POE (CANOE-SHAPE).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Burial cairns, called “ahu poe-poe,” were being made in modern
times, and a man skilled in their construction was amongst those
who were carried off to Peru. The word “poe-poe” is described
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>as meaning a big canoe, such as their ancestors came in to
the island. It is applied to two types of ahu, one of which is
obviously built to resemble a boat; of this kind there are about
twelve in the island. One large one (fig. 94) measured as much
as 178 feet in length, the width being 20 feet, while the ends,
which are made like the bow and stern of a canoe, are about
10 feet to 15 feet in height. The flat top is paved with sea-boulders,
and is surrounded by a row of the same in imitation of
the gunwale of a boat. In one such ahu two vaults were found
by us just below the surface with perfect burials. One was
the body of an old man, the other of a woman with a child. Both
had been wrapped in reeds, and with the body of the woman
were some glass beads. On the surface of the ahu were a few
bones, possibly of a body which had been exposed there, but the
ahu had apparently been built for the two interments. It is less
obvious why the same name, “ahu poe-poe,” should be applied
to a burial-place which was wedge-shaped in form. It follows the
lines of the image ahu in so far as having a wall towards the sea
flanked on the land sides by a slope of masonry. It might be
held to represent the prow of a boat, but resembles rather a pier
or jetty. Only some six of these were seen, of which the longest
was 70 feet. One in a lonely spot, at the very edge of a high
cliff, which overlooked Anakena Bay, formed a most striking
abode for the dead (fig. 95).</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few cases the term ahu is given to a pavement, generally
by the roadside, neatly made of rounded boulders and edged
with a curb; the form was said to be ancient. One of those on
the west road was reported as specially dedicated to mata-toa—which
signifies victors or warriors—and the same was said of
a differently made ahu on the south coast.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Neither exposure nor interment was necessarily confined to
ahu, and corpses were frequently disposed of in caverns, as in
the case of Ko Tori. Three instances were mentioned, an uncle
and two nephews, where the corpses, after being exposed, were
lowered with a rope down the crevasses of the cliff of Raraku
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>in order to evade the enemy. One of the nephews, who had
been of the party when the final statues were overthrown, had
met with a tragic end, being drowned by catching his hand in
a rock when diving for lobsters under water. With the exception
of those near the standing statues, we practically never
found an earth burial. This seems to account for the exaggerated
estimates of the number of human remains on the island; it is
doubtful if even five hundred skulls could be collected, but,
whether in caves or ruined ahu, a large proportion of those
which exist are very much in evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Memorials of the dead were erected in various places independently
of the actual locality where the corpse rested. Some
of these were simply mounds of earth, which can be seen on
various hills; there is a regular succession on the landward rim
of the Raraku crater, opposite to the great cliff, but one at least
of these was a memorial to a man whose body had been disposed
of in the clefts of the cliff. Others of these independent memorials
were in the shape of cairns about 6 feet in height, known as
“pipi-hereko,” and were formerly surmounted by a white stone.
Many of them still exist, and they are particularly numerous on
the high ground above Anakena Cove. The locality was chosen
as one which was but little inhabited, for the taboo for the dead
(or pera) extended to them, and no one went near them in the
daylight, on penalty of being stoned, till the period of mourning
had been terminated with the usual feast. Various voyagers
commented on these cairns, which were marked objects, and
Cook thinks that they may have been put up instead of statues.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem by the following tale, which imposes a somewhat
severe strain on the European imagination, that piles of
stones had in the native mind a certain resemblance to the
human figure. “There was once an old lady who had an arm
so long that it could have reached right across the island. She
was a bad old woman, and once a month had a child to eat, so
a certain man determined to put an end to her power for doing
harm. He took her out in a boat to fish, first telling his small
son to collect stones, and after they had gone to put them in
piles in front of the house of the woman, and also to make a fire
and much smoke. When the canoe had got out to sea, he looked
back and found the boy had done as he was told, and glimpses
of the cairns could be seen among the clouds of smoke. Then
he called to the old woman, ‘Look, there are men at your house!’
So she put out her long arm to seize what she thought were the
people going to rob her hut, whereon the man seized the paddle
and brought it down on her arm and broke it; then he killed
the old woman and threw her body into the sea.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Life was by no means dull in Easter Island, for if a feast was
not being given to commemorate a departed relation, it was
arranged in honour of one whilst still alive. The “<span class='fss'>PAINA</span>,” which
means simply picture or representation, was given by the family
as a testimonial of esteem to a father, or possibly a brother who
might be either alive or dead; it was a serious matter, and the
original direction for the celebration came from a supernaturally
gifted individual known as an “ivi-atua.” The paina was a large
figure made of woven rods, and the host would clamber up inside
it and look through eyes or mouth; it had a crown made of
the wings of a particular sea-bird, known as “makohe,” and long
ears. Occasionally it was put up on a special spot, where, for
example, a man had been killed, but the interesting point in
connection with the paina is that the usual place for erection was
in front of an image ahu on its landward side, and at most, or
all, of the large ahu, there can still be seen, in the grass at the
foot of the paved slope, the holes where the paina have stood.
It was kept in place by four long ropes, one of which passed over
the ahu. The feast was held in the summer, and lasted from
two to four days; at any given ahu there might be only one
in the season or as many as five. The drawbacks, which would
have seemed obvious to such a locality, do not seem to have
clouded the entertainment; the feasting was great, and consisted
largely of rats which were caught in the hen-houses. The recollection
of these entertainments and the crowds who attended
them were very vivid, and Viriamo’s eyes brightened as she told
of the singing, dancing, and feasting of her youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are records of another figure which appears to have
been different from the paina; it was clothed and known as
“<span class='fss'>KO PEKA</span>.” The Spanish Expedition in 1770 says that the
islanders brought down to the beach, on the day when the three
crosses were set up, an idol about 11 feet high like a “Judas,”
stuffed with straw; it was all white, and had a fringe of black
hair hanging down its back. They put it up on stones and sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>cross-legged around it, howling all night by the light of flares.
As no information was volunteered to us about such celebrations,
the natives were asked if they had ever known a similar figure,
and an old man at once replied that there had existed one just
like the description, made of reeds, as a memorial of a dead wife
or “fine” child; it stood in front of the house, or was sometimes
carried to a hillock where the people assembled to mourn. One
of the officers of the La Pérouse Expedition also described a
figure seen near a platform; it was 11 feet in height, clothed in
white tapa (“<i><span lang="fr">étoffe blanche du pays</span></i>”); it had hanging round
the neck a basket covered with white, and by the side of this bag
the figure of a child 2 feet long. This seems to confirm the
information that it was intended to represent a woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another great festivity, given for a father either living or dead,
was the “<span class='fss'>KORO</span>.” This was a house-party on a very extended
scale. A special dwelling made with poles and thatched was put
up, and, according to accounts, which surround it no doubt
with a halo from the past, measured some hundreds of feet in
length and 20 feet in height. An old man stated that at a
celebration at which he was present there were “a hundred
guests,” a number which is probably a guess, but the addition
that there were “ten cooking-places” sounds like memory.
Invitations to these festivities were much in request, as there was
“no work to do”; presents of food were brought to the hero who
distributed them to the party. They seem to have lasted indefinitely,
going on for months, and the time was passed with
various entertainments. The old people sang, the young people
danced, and the host, who lived in a little house near, came and
looked on. On the last day there was a great feast, and the house
was broken down with the aid of the carved wooden lizards,
which are associated with the island (fig. 117). We were
puzzled in coming across a rough stone building, near Anakena,
which seemed to be neither ahu, dwelling, nor chicken-house;
it had been, the men told us, a shelter for the posts of the koro,
where they were kept in readiness for the next celebration.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was yet another entertainment which is said to have
been in honour of a mother, as a koro was of a father. In at
least four different places on the island are to be seen a dancing-ground
known as “<span class='fss'>KAUNGA</span>.” It is a narrow strip paved with
pebbles, over 200 feet in length by 2 feet in width, and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>unlike the paved approach to some of the ahu. A demonstration
was given of the way it was used. The dancers, “fine men, fine
women,” as was explained with emphasis, proceeding along it
single file, holding rapa in both hands. In connection
with some or all of the kaunga there was a house where the
party remained indoors for a long time previous to the dances,
in order to “get their complexions good,” a touch which shows
that a white skin was admired.</p>

<p class='c007'>These feasts were held in certain months only, determined by
the appearance of the heavens after nightfall. On the extremity
of the eastern headland there is an outcrop of boulders, one of
which is incised with a spiral design; the place is known as
“Ko Te Papa-ui-hetuu,” or, “The Rock-for-seeing-stars,” and
here the old men came to watch the constellations. About two
hundred yards from these boulders there is another engraved
stone on which ten cup-shaped depressions are visible; this
represented, it is said, “a map of the stars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The season for the Paina depended on the position of the
three central stars of Orion, with regard to which the following
story is related. A certain married woman, on going down to
bathe, was carried off by a stranger. When her husband discovered
this, he slew her in his anger, and she fled up to be
a star. The husband then took their two boys, one in each
hand, and followed her to the sky, where the three form the
belt of Orion. The wife, however, would have nothing to do
with them, and remained in a separate part of the heavens.
This is the only nature myth which we encountered on the
island.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>Religion</h4>

<p class='c024'>The religion of the Islanders, employing the word in our sense,
seems always to have been somewhat hazy,<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a> and the difficulty
in grasping it now is increased by the fact that since becoming
Roman Catholics they dislike giving the name of “atua,” or
god, to their old deities; it only drops out occasionally. They
term them “aku-aku,” which means spirits, or more frequently
“tatane,” a word of which the derivation is obvious. The confusion
of ideas was crystallised by a native, who gravely remarked
that they were uncertain whether one of these beings was God or
the Devil, so they “wrote to Tahiti, and Tahiti wrote to Rome,
and Rome said he was not the Devil, he was God”; a modern
view being apparently taken at headquarters of the evolution
of religious ideas. Both these words, tatane and aku-aku, will
be employed for supernatural beings, without prejudice to their
original character, or claims to divinity; some of them were
certainly the spirits of the dead, but had probably become deified;
the ancestors of Hotu-matua were reported to have come
with him to the island. They existed in large numbers, being
both male and female, and were connected with different parts
of the island; a list of about ninety was given, with their places of
residence. No worship was paid, and the only notice taken
of these supernatural persons was to mention before meals
the names of those to whom a man owed special duty, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>invite them to partake; it was etiquette to mention with your
own the patron of any guest who was present. There was no
sacrifice; the invitation to the supernatural power was purely
formal, or restricted to the essence of the food only. Nevertheless,
the aku-aku, in this at least being human, were amiable or
the reverse according to whether or not they were well fed. If
they were hungry, they ate women and children, and one was
reported as having a proclivity for stealing potatoes; if, on the
contrary, they were well-disposed to a man, they would do work
for him, and he would wake in the morning to find his potato-field
dug, which, as our informant truly remarked, was “no
like Kanaka.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The aku-aku appeared in human form, in which they were
indistinguishable from ordinary persons. One known as Uka-o-hoheru
looked like a very beautiful woman, and was the wife
of a young Tupahotu who had no idea she was really a tatane.
She lived with him at Mahatua on the north coast, and bore
him a child. One very wet day she was obliged to leave the
house to take fresh fire to the cooking-place where it had gone
out. When she returned, her husband was angry that she had
no red paint on her face, and, not heeding her explanation that
the rain had washed it off, took a stick to beat her. She ran
away, and he followed, till at last she sat down on the edge of the
eastern headland, where there is now an ahu known by her
name. When by and by he came up, she told him to go back
and look after the child, and fled away like a rushing whirlwind
over the sea and was no more seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two other female tatane are reported to have lived together
in a cave on the cliff-side of Paréhé,<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a> whose names were Kava-ara
and Kava-tua. They heard all men tell of the beauty of a
certain Uré-a-hohové, a young man who lived near Hanga Roa;
so they went down to see him, put him to sleep, and carried
him on his mat up to their cave, where they left him. Before
going away they told an old woman, also an aku-aku, that she
was not to go and look into the cave. This she naturally proceeded
to do, and, finding Uré, warned him to eat nothing the two
tatane might give to him, supplying him herself with some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>chicken. When therefore his captors came back and offered
him food, he only pretended to take it, and ate the chicken
instead. They then went away again. The old woman came
back, and said, “If cockroaches come, kill them; if flies come,
kill them; but if a crab comes, do not kill it.” Uré did as
he was told, and killed the cockroaches and flies, which were
other tatane; but the crab he did not kill, it was the old woman.
Meanwhile for many days the father of Uré wept for him, till
some men sailing under the cliff while fishing, heard a song, and
looking up saw the missing man; but they would not go and
fetch him, though the father gave them much food, for the cliff
was steep and the cave difficult to reach. At last a woman
volunteered for the task, and was lowered over the cliff in a net,
and by this means succeeded in fetching Uré safely to the top.
The history ends with his return to his home, and does not
mention if, in correct fashion, he married his fair deliverer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aku-aku were not immortal. A man called Raraku, after
whom the mountain is said to have been named, caught a big
“heke,” which seems to have been an octopus, in the sea near
Tongariki and ate it, with the result that he went mad, and all
people gave chase to him. He caught up a wooden lizard (fig. 117),
and, using it as a club, ran amok among tatane across the north
shore and down the west coast, killing them right and left; the
names of twenty-three were given who thus met their fate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Human beings, on the other hand, were liable to be attacked
by tatane, more particularly at night, when there was risk, not
only to their bodies, but also to their own spirits,<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a> which were
at large while they slept. It is still firmly believed that in
dreams the soul visits any locality present to the thought. On
one of the ahu is a rough erection of slabs, said to be the house
of the aku-aku Mata-wara-wara, or “Strong-Rain.” He had as
a partner another aku-aku called Papai-a-taki-vera, and they arranged
between them that Mata should bring on rain, while Papai
constructed a house of reeds which was only there at night; then
when the spirits of sleeping people, which were wandering abroad,
became cold with the rain, they went into the house and the
tatane killed them. The unfortunate sleeper waked in the
morning feeling distinctly unwell, he lingered on for two or three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>days, and then died. It was not essential to life to have a soul,
but you could not really get on comfortably without it. No
knowledge survives of any belief or ideas with regard to a future
state. The spirit, it was said, appeared occasionally for five
or ten years after a man’s death and then vanished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pan in the shape of tatane is by no means dead. Not only do
such beings haunt the crater of Rano Raraku, but tales are told
of weird apparitions at dusk which vanish mysteriously into
space.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were no priests, but certain men, known as “koremaké,”
practised spells which would secure the death of an enemy, and
there was also the class known as “ivi-atua,” which included
both men and women. The most important of these ivi-atua, of
whom it was said there might be perhaps ten in the island, held
commune with the aku-aku, others were able to prophesy, and
could foresee the whereabouts of fish or turtle, while some had
the gift of seeing hidden things, and would demand contributions
from a secreted store of bananas or potatoes, in a way which was
very disconcerting to the owner.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was practically only one religious function of a general
nature; it was very popular and had a surprising origin.
Attention was attracted on the south coast by a particularly
long stoep of rounded pebbles measuring 139 feet, and obviously
connected with a thatched house now disappeared. That, our
guides said in answer to a question, “is a haré-a-té-atua, where
they praised the gods.” “What gods?” “The men who came
from far away in ships. They saw they had pink cheeks, and
they said they were gods.” The early voyagers, for the cult
went back at least three generations, were therefore taken for
deities in the same way as Cook was at Hawaii. The simplest
form of this celebration took place on long mounds of earth
known as “miro-o-orne,” or earth-ships, of which there are
several in the island, one of them with a small mound near it
to represent a boat. Here the natives used to gather together
and act the part of a European crew, one taking the lead and
giving orders to the others. A more formal ceremony was
held in a large house. This had three doors on each side by
which the singers entered, who were up to a hundred in number,
and ranged themselves in lines within; in one house, of which a
diagram was drawn, a deep hole was dug in the middle, at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>bottom of which was a gourd covered with a stone to act as a drum.
On the top of this a man danced, being hidden out of sight in
the hole.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other cases, two, or perhaps three, boats were constructed
inside the house, the masts of which went through the roof;
these boats were manned with crews clad in the garments of
European sailors, the gifts from passing vessels being kept as
stage properties. Fresh music was composed for every occasion,
and in one song, which was quoted, much reference is made to
the “red face of the captain from over the seas.” The position
of chief performer was one of great honour, being analogous, on
a glorified scale, to the leader of a cotillon of our own day. It
was stated by an old man that his great-grandfather had so acted,
and even the words sung were still remembered. Te Haha, a
Miru (fig. 83), gave us to understand that he had been a great
social success in his youth, and counted up three koro, and seven
haré-até-atua at which he had been present. As he was a
handsome old man, and was connected with the court of the
chief Ngaara, his pride of recollection was very probably
justified. Juan, mixing up, no doubt, recollections of a later
date, gave a vivid representation on one of these spots of the
pseudo-captain striding about and using very strong language,
while he called upon the engineer to “make more smoke so that
the ship should go fast.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Miru Clan</span></h4>

<p class='c024'>On the border-line, between religion and magic, wherever, if anywhere,
that line exists, was the position of the clan known as the
Miru. Members of this group had, in the opinion of the islanders,
the supernatural and valuable gift of being able to increase all food
supplies, especially that of chickens, and this power was particularly
in evidence after death. It has been known that certain
skulls from Easter are marked with designs, such as the outline of
a fish; these are crania of the Miru, and called “puoko-moa,” or
fowl-heads, because they had, in particular, the quality of making
hens lay eggs (fig. 96). Hotu, the Miru, whose mother, it may
be remembered, was the victim of a cannibal feast, made his
own skull an heirloom, as “it was so extremely good for chickens,”
that he did not wish it to go out of the family. His son gave it
to a relative, who was the father of an old man from whom we
managed to obtain it. When the time came to hand it over to
us, the late owner began to cling to it affectionately, and say
that he “wept much at the thought of its going to England”;
as, however, the bargain had already been completed, we remained
obdurate, and at the time of writing Hotu resides with
Ko Tori at the Royal College of Surgeons.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>The Miru were unique in other ways; they were the only group
which had a headman or chief, who was known as the “ariki,” or
sometimes as the “ariki-mau,” the great chief, to distinguish him
from the “ariki-paka,” a term which seems to have been given
to all other members of the clan.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> The office of ariki-mau was
hereditary, and he was the only man who was obliged to marry
into his own clan. It was customary when he was old and feeble
that he should resign in favour of his son. There are various
lists of the succession of chiefs, counted from the first immigrant,
Hotu-matua. The oldest lists are those given by Bishop Jaussen<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
and by Admiral Lapelin,<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> which contain some thirty names.
Thomson gives one with fifty-seven. In our day there was
admittedly much uncertainty about the sequence, but the
number was said to be thirty,<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a> and two independent lists were
obtained. All these categories differ, though they contain many
of the same names, particularly at the beginning and end.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last man to fill the post of ariki with its original dignity
was Ngaara; he died shortly before the Peruvian raid, and
becomes a very real personage to anyone inquiring into the
history of the island. He was short, and very stout, with white
skin, as had all his family, but so heavily tattooed as to look
black. He wore feather hats of various descriptions, and was
hung round both back and front with little wooden ornaments,
which jingled as he walked. When our authorities can remember
him his wife was dead and he lived with his son Kaimokoi. It
was not permitted to see them eat, and no one but the servants
was allowed to enter the house. His headquarters were at
Anakena, the cove on the island where, according to tradition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the first canoe landed. It is unique in having a sandy shore, and
is surrounded by an amphitheatre of low hills. Behind it to the
west rises the high central ground of the island, beyond it, on the
other side, is the eastern plain; it thus approximately terminates
the strip of land held by the Miru (fig. 97). There are now at
Anakena the remains of six ahu, a few statues, and the foundations
of various houses. Ngaara held official position for the
whole island, but he was neither a leader in war, nor the fount of
justice, nor even a priest; he can best be described as the custodian
of certain customs and traditions. The act most nearly
approaching a religious ceremony was conducted under his
auspices, though not by him personally. In time of drought
he sent up a younger son and other ariki-paka to a hill-top to
pray for rain: they were painted on one side red, on the other
black with a stripe down the centre. These prayers were addressed
to Hiro, said to be the god of the sky, a supernatural
being in whom we seem getting nearer the idea of a divinity,
as distinct from a spirit of the dead, and of whom we would
gladly have learnt more than could be discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ariki-paka had other duties besides praying for rain; they
made “maru,” or strings of white feathers tied on to sticks, which
they placed among the yams to make them grow. They buried a
certain small fish among the sugar-canes to bring up the plants,
and when a koro was being held, and it was consequently particularly
desirable that the fowls should thrive, an ariki-paka
painted a design in red, known as the “rei-miro,” below the door
of the chicken-house (fig. 115).</p>

<p class='c007'>Te Haha, the “social success,” who was an ariki-paka in the
entourage of Ngaara, gave graphic descriptions of life at Anakena
when he was a boy. If, he said, people wanted chickens, they
applied to the Ariki-mau, who sent him with maru, and his
visits were always attended with satisfactory results.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ngaara never consumed rats, and one day, coming across the
boy watching rats being cooked, he was extremely angry, for it
transpired that, if Te Haha had eaten them, his power for producing
chickens would have diminished; presumably because he
would have imbibed ratty nature, which was disastrous to eggs
and young chickens. The Ariki, however, made himself useful to
him on occasion. The younger Miru had long hair reaching to his
heels, and one day, when he was asleep in a cave, some one cut it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>off. So he went to Ngaara, who told him to bring ten coconuts,
which he broke and put in pieces of the sacred tree, “ngau-ngau”;
the spell blasted the offender, who promptly died. Ngaara himself
attended the inauguration of any house of importance. The
wooden lizards were put formally on each side of the entrance
to the porch, and the Ariki and an ivi-atua, who “went with
him like a tatane,” were the first to eat in the new dwelling:
only the houses with stone foundations were thus honoured.
The Ariki was visited one month in the year by “all people,”
who brought him the plant known as pua on the end of sticks,
put the pua into his house, and retired backwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>He also held receptions on other occasions, seated on the
broken-off head of an old image, which was pointed out on a
grassy declivity among the hills behind Anakena; these were
special occasions for criticising the tattoo. Those who were well
tattooed were sent to stand on one hill slope, whilst those who
were badly done were sent to another; the Ariki and men behind
him laughed contemptuously at the latter, which, as the process
was permanent and could not be altered, seems slightly unkind.
These receptions were also attended by men who had made
boats, and by twins, to whom the Ariki gave a “royal name.”
Such children were not, as in so many countries, considered
unlucky, but it was necessary that at birth they should live in
a house apart, otherwise they would not survive. This superstition
still exists. Shortly before our arrival a woman in the
village had given birth to twins, for whom a little grass house
was put up; another woman went in and brought them out to
the mother to nurse.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Script</span></h4>

<p class='c024'>Closely connected with the subject of the Miru clan is that
of the method of writing. While we can only catch glimpses of
the image cult through the mists of antiquity, the tablets, known
as “koháu-rongo-rongo,”<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a> were an integral part of life on the
island within the memory of men not much past middle age
(fig. 98). The highest authority on them was the ariki Ngaara.
It was tantalising to feel how near we were to their translation
and yet how far. Te Haha had begun to learn to write, but found
that his hand shook too much, besides, as he explained, Ngaara
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>used “to send him to the chickens.” Juan had had the offer
of learning one form of such script, but, not unnaturally, had
looked upon it with some contempt, preferring European accomplishments.
The information which could be gathered was,
therefore, with one exception, which will be noted later, simply
that of the layman, or man in the street, who had been aware
of the existence of the art and seen it going on around him, but
had no personal knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tablets were of all sizes up to 6 feet. It was a picturesque
sight to see an old man pick up a piece of banana-stem, larger
than himself, from among the grove in which we were talking,
and stagger along with it to show what it meant to carry a
tablet, though, as he explained, the sides of the tablet were flat,
not round like the stem. It is said that the original symbols
were brought to the island by the first comers, and that they
were on “paper,” that when the paper was done, their ancestors
made them from the banana plant, and when it was found that
withered they resorted to wood. Every clan had professors in
the art who were known as rongo-rongo men (“tangata-rongo-rongo”).
They had houses apart, the sites of which are shown in
various localities. Here they practised their calling, often sitting
and working with their pupils in the shade of the bananas; their
wives had separate establishments. In writing, the incision was
made with a shark’s tooth: the beginners worked on the outer
sheaths of banana-stems, and later were promoted to use the
wood known as “toro-miro.”<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The glyphs are, as will be seen, so arranged that when the
figures of one row are right way up, those of the one immediately
below it are on their heads; thus only alternate rows can, at the
same time, be seen in correct position (fig. 98). The method
of reading was, according to Te Haha, to read one row from left
to right, then come back reading the next from right to left, the
method known as boustrophedon, from the manner in which an
ox ploughs a furrow. The finished ones were wrapped in reeds
and hung up in the houses. According to two independent
authorities they could only be touched by the professors or their
servants, and were taboo to the uninitiated, which, however,
does not quite agree with other statements, nor with that of the
missionaries that they were to be found in “every house.” They
were looked upon as prizes to be carried off in war, but they
were often burnt with the houses in tribal conflict.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Ngaara is said to have had “hundreds of kohau” in his
house, and instructed in the art, which he had learnt from his
grandfather. He is described, with a vivid personal touch, as
teaching the words, holding a tablet in one hand and swaying
from side to side as he recited. Besides giving instruction, he
inspected the candidates prepared by other professors, who were
generally their own sons; he looked at their kohau and made
them read, on which he either passed them, clapping if they did
well, or turned them back. Their sponsors were made personally
responsible. If the pupils acquitted themselves creditably,
presents of kohau were made to the teachers; if the youth failed,
the tablets of the instructor were taken away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every year there was a great gathering of rongo-rongo men at
Anakena, according to Te Haha, as many as several hundreds of
them came together. The younger and more energetic of the
population assembled from all districts in the island to look on.
They brought “heu-heu” (feathers on the top of sticks), tied pua
on to them, and stuck the sticks in the ground all round the place.
The inhabitants of the neighbouring districts brought offerings
of food to Ngaara, that he should be able to supply the multitude,
and the oven was “five yards along.” The gathering was near
the principal ahu, midway between the sandy shore and the
background of hills. The Ariki and his son Kaimokoi sat on
seats made of tablets, and each had a tablet in his hand; they
wore feather hats, as did all the professors. The rongo-rongo
men were arranged in rows, with an alley-way down the centre
to the Ariki. Some of them had brought with them one tablet
only; others as many as four. The old ones read in turn, or
sometimes two together, from the places where they stood, but
their tablets were not inspected. Te Haha and his comrades stood
on the outskirts, and he and one other lad held maru in their hands.
If a young man failed, he was called up and his errors pointed out;
but if an old man did not read well, Ngaara would beckon to Te
Haha, who would go up to the man and take him out by the ear.
Our informant repeated this part of the story identically months
later, and added that the Ariki would say to the culprit, “Are you
not ashamed to be taken out by a child?”; the offender’s hat
was taken away, but the tablet was not inspected.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>The entire morning was spent in hearing one half of the men
read; there was an interval at midday for a meal, after which the
remainder recited, the whole performance lasting till evening.
Fights occasionally ensued from people scoffing at those who failed.
Ngaara would then call Te Haha’s attention to it, and the boy
would go up to the offenders with the maru in his hand and look
at them, when they would stop and there would be no more
noise. When the function was over, the Ariki stood on a platform
borne by eight men and addressed the rongo-rongo men on their
duties, and doing well, and gave them each a chicken. Another
old man, Jotefa, gave a different account of the great assembly,
by which the Ariki sat on his stoep and the old men stood before
him and “prayed”; according to this version they either did
not bring their tablets or their doing so was voluntary. In
addition to the great day, there were minor assemblies at new
moon, or the last quarter of the moon, when the rongo-rongo
men came to Anakena. The Ariki walked up and down reading
the tablets, while the old men stood in a body and looked on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ngaara used also to travel round the island, staying for a
week or two in different localities with the resident experts.
Another savant on the south coast was said to be “too big a
man to have a school,” and also went about visiting and inspecting
learned establishments in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ngaara, before the end, fell on evil days. The Ngaure clan
was in the ascendancy, and carried off the Miru as slaves; the
Ariki was taken to Akahanga on the south coast with his son,
Kaimokoi, and grandson, Maurata. They were there five years
in captivity, and the “Miru cried much”; at the end of that
time the clan united with the Tupahotu and rescued the old man.
He was then ill, and died not long afterwards at Tahai, on the
west coast, near Hanga Roa, while living with his daughter, who
had married a Marama. For six days after his death everyone
worked at making the sticks with feathers on the top (heu-heu),
and they were put all round the place. He was buried in the
ruined image ahu at Tahai, his body being carried on three of
the tablets, and followed through a lane of spectators by the
rongo-rongo men; the tablets were buried with him. His head
paid the penalty of its greatness, and was subsequently stolen;
its whereabouts was unknown. Ten or fifteen of his tablets
were given to old men; the rest went to a servant, Pito, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>on his death to Maurata. When Maurata went to Peru, Také,
a relative of Te Haha, obtained them, and Salmon asked Te Haha
to get hold of them for him. Také, however, unfortunately
owed Te Haha a grudge, because when Te Haha was in Salmon’s
service, and consequently well off, he did not give him as many
presents as his relative thought should have been forthcoming,
and he consequently refused to surrender them. They were
hidden in a cave whose general locality was surmised, but Také
died without making known the exact site, and they could never
be found. Kaimokoi’s tablets were burnt in war.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question remains what were the subjects with which the
tablets dealt, and in what manner did they record them? Various
attempts have been made to deal with a problem which will
probably never be wholly solved. Twice before our own day
native assistance has been sought to decipher them. It will be
remembered that the existence of these glyphs was first reported
by the missionaries; but even at that time, when volunteers
were asked for who could translate them, none came forward.
Bishop Jaussen, Vicaire Apostolique of Tahiti, managed to find
in that island a native of Easter among those brought there to
work on the Brander plantations, who was supposed to understand
them, and who read them after the boustrophedon method.
From the information given by him, the Bishop was satisfied
that the signs represented different things, such as sun, stars,
the ariki, and so forth, and has given a list of the figures and
their equivalent. At the same time he held that each one was
only a peg on which to hang much longer matter which was
committed to memory. The other attempt to obtain a translation
was that of Paymaster Thomson, of U.S.S. <em>Mohican</em>, in 1886.
There was then living an old man, Ure-vae-iko by name, who
was said to be the last to understand the form of writing; he
declined to assist in deciphering them on the ground that his
religious teachers had said it would imperil his soul. Photographs,
however, were shown, and, by the aid of stimulants, he
was induced to give a version of their meaning, the words of
which were taken down by Salmon. It was, however, remarked
that when the photographs were changed, the words proceeded
just the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inquiries were made by the Expedition about this old man,
and it was agreed by the islanders that he had never possessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>any tablets nor could he make them, but that he had been a
servant of Ngaara and had learnt to repeat them. Before
leaving the island we went with the old men through the five
translations given by Thomson. Of three nothing was known;
one which describes the process of creation was recognised as
that of a kohau, but looked at a little askance, as there were
Tahitian words in it. The last was laughed out of court as
being merely a love-song which everyone knew.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our own early experiences had resembled those of the Americans.
Photographs of tablets, which were produced merely to
elicit general information, were to our surprise promptly read,
certain words being assigned to each figure; but after a great
deal of trouble had been taken, in drawing the signs and writing
down the particular matter, it was found that any figure did
equally well. The natives were like children pretending to read
and only reciting. It was noted, however, with interest, that
in perhaps half a dozen cases different persons recited words
approximately the same, beginning, “He timo te ako-ako, he
ako-ako tena,” and on inquiry it was said that they were derived
from one of the earliest tablets and were generally known. It
was “like the alphabet learned first”; Ure-vai-iko had stated
that they were the “great old words,” all others being only
“little ones.” To get any sort of translation was a difficult
matter, to ask for it was much the same as for a stranger solemnly
to inquire the meaning of some of our own old nursery rhymes,
such as “Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle”—some words
could be explained, others could not, the whole meaning was
unknown. It seems safe, however, to assume that at least we
have here the contents of one of the old tablets.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to other kohau, a list was obtained of the subjects
with which they were believed to deal. These amounted
to thirteen in all, most of the names being given by several
different persons. We have seen that there was a kohau of the
“Ika,” the murdered men; this was known to only one professor,
who taught it to a pupil, and the two divided the island
between them, the master taking the west and north coast to
Anakena and the pupil the remainder. A connected, or possibly
the same, tablet was made at the instance of the relatives of the
victim and helped to secure vengeance. Certain kohau were
said to be lists of wars; some dealt with ceremonies, and others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>formed part of ceremonies themselves. They were in evidence
at koro, where Ngaara and the professors used to come and
“pray for the father,” and a woman went on to the roof of the
house holding the “Kohau-o-te-puré” (prayer tablet). In another
case, a woman who wished to honour her father-in-law, and at
the same time secure fertility, set up a pole round which she
walked holding a child and a tablet, given her by Ngaara, while
he and other rongo-rongo men who brought their kohau at his
order stood by and sang.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the most interesting tablet was one known as the
“Kohau-o-te-ranga.” The story was told to us sitting on the
foundation of a house on the east side of Raraku, the aspect
which is not quarried. This house, it was said, had been the
abode of two men, who were old when the informant was a boy,
and who taught the rongo-rongo; some days ten students would
come, other days fifteen. The wives and children of the old
men lived in another house lower down the mountain. One of
the experts, Arohio by name, was a Tupahotu, and had as a
friend another member of the same clan called Kaara. Kaara
was servant to the Ariki, and had been taught rongo-rongo by
him, and Ngaara, trusting him entirely, gave into his care this
most valuable kohau known as “ranga.” It was the only one
of the kind in existence, and was reported to have been brought
by the first immigrants; it had the notable property of securing
victory to its holders, in such a manner that they were able to
get hold of the enemy for the “ranga”—that is, as captives or
slaves for manual labour. Kaara, anxious to obtain the talisman
for his own clan, stole the kohau and gave it to Arohio, who kept
it in this house. When Ngaara asked for it, the man said that
it was at Raraku, but before the Ariki could get hold of it, Arohio
sent it back to Kaara, and these two thus sent it backwards and
forwards to one another, lying to Ngaara when needful. The
Ariki seems to have taken a somewhat feeble line, and, instead
of punishing his servant, merely tried to bribe him, with the
result that he never again saw his kohau. The son of Arohio
sold it to one of the missionaries, and it is presumably one of
those which went to Tahiti. The matters with which it would
naturally have been supposed that the rongo-rongo would deal,
such as genealogies, lists of ariki, or the wanderings of the people,
were never mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>We were fortunately just in time to come across a man who
had been able to make one species of glyphs, though he was no
longer, alas! in the hey-day of his powers. We were shown one
day in the village a piece of paper taken from a Chilean manuscript
book, on which were somewhat roughly drawn a number
of signs, some of them similar to those already known, others
different from any we had seen (fig. 99). They were found
to have been derived from an old man known as Tomenika.
He was, by report, the last man acquainted with an inferior
kind of rongo-rongo known as the “tau,” but was now ill and
confined to the leper colony. We paid a visit to him armed with
a copy of the signs, but found him inside his doorway, which it
was obviously undesirable to enter, and disinclined to give help;
he acknowledged the figures as his work, recited “He timo te
ako-ako,” and explained some of the signs as having to do with
“Jesus Christ.” The outlook was not promising.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another visit, however, was paid, this time with Juan’s assistance,
and though the old man appeared childish, and the natives
frankly said that “he had lost his memory,” things went better.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was seated on a blanket outside his grass-hut, bare-legged,
wearing a long coat and felt hat; he had piercing brown eyes,
and in younger days must have been both good-looking and
intelligent. He asked if we wanted the tau, and requested a
paper and pencil. The former he put on the ground in front
of him between his legs, and took hold of the pencil with his
thumb above and first finger below; he made three vertical lines,
first of noughts then of ticks, gave a name to each line, and
proceeded to recite. There was no doubt about the genuineness
of the recitation, but he gabbled fast, and when asked to go
slowly so that it could be taken down, was put out and had to
begin again; he obviously used the marks simply to keep
count of the different phrases. At the end of the visit he offered
to write something for next time. We left some paper with him,
and on our return two or three days later he had drawn five lines
horizontally, of which four were in the form of the glyphs, but
the same figure was constantly repeated, and there were not
more than a dozen different symbols in all. It was said by the
escort to be “lazy writing.” Tomenika complained that the
paper was not “big enough,” so another sheet was given, which
was put by the side of the first and the lines continued in turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>horizontally. He drew from left to right rapidly and easily.
Unfortunately, it did not seem wise to touch the paper, but
the writing was copied, by looking over it as he went on, with
the sincere hope that his blanket did not contain too many
inhabitants of some infectious variety. The recitation was
partly the same as on the previous occasion, the signs taking
the place of ticks; anything from three or four to ten words
were said to each sign. If he made a variation when asked to
repeat, it was in transposing the order of two phrases; evidently
the signs themselves were not to him, now at any rate, connected
with particular words.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we subsequently went with our escort into the meaning
of the words, it was found that the latter half of each phrase
generally consisted of one of the lower numericals preceded by the
word “tau,” or year—thus, “the year four,” “the year five,”
etc.; the numbers, roughly speaking, ran in order of sequence up
to ten, recommencing with each line. The first part of the phrase
was generally said to be the name of a man, but of this it was
difficult to judge, as children were called after any object or
place; thus “flowering grass” might be the name of a thing,
or of a place, or of a man called after either the object or the
locality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Happily, one of the most reliable old men, Kapiera by name,
had at one time lived with Tomenika, who was said to have been
in those days always busy writing; and he was able to explain
the general bearing of the tau. When a koro was made in
honour of a father, an expert was called in to commemorate the
old man’s deeds, “how many men he had killed, how many
chickens he had stolen,” and a tablet was made accordingly.
There was, in addition, a larger tablet containing a list of these
lesser ones, and giving merely the name of each hero and the
year of his koro. It would read somewhat thus, “James the
year four, Charles the year five,” and so forth, going up to the
year ten, when the numbers began again. If there were two
koro in a year, they came under the same numeral. It was this
general summary which had been recited by Tomenika, and,
though there was a certain amount of confusion, each line seems
to have represented a decade. In addition, as will be seen,
“James” and “Charles” each had a kohau of their own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kapiera was able to give a specimen of the lesser tau; it illustrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>interestingly the general method of condensation in which,
even in the recitations, a few words assume or implicate extended
knowledge. It ran thus, “Of Kao the year nine,” “Ngakurariha
the eldest”; then come five men’s names followed by the name
of a fish; then a doubtful word; then “that side island my place.”
“I see Ngakurariha at the koro.” The story, as explained, was
that Kao, a man of Vinapu on the south coast, and Ngakurariha,
his eldest son, went to Mahatua on the north side and stayed
with the five men whose names are given, who were brothers,
and learnt from them the tau. Having done this, they proceeded
to murder them, and went and took a fish, then returned to
Rano Kao, made a koro and the tau.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tau was, it was said, originally made by an ancestor of the
first immigrant chief, Hotu-matua; it was not taboo in the same
way as the other rongo-rongo, and was not known to Ngaara.
There were, about the beginning of last century, only three
personages acquainted with it. One was Omatohi, a Tupahotu,
whose son, Tea-a-tea, was Tomenika’s foster-father and instructor
in the art. It was said by Tomenika himself and by
others that he “only knew part,” and there were other signs
with which he was not acquainted, for his foster-father had
died before he knew all.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great effort was subsequently made to get further information
from Tomenika, more particularly as to the exact method of
writing, but he was back in his hut very ill, and all conversation
had once more to be done through the doorway. Every way
that could be thought of was tried to elicit information, but
without real success. He did draw two fresh symbols, saying
first they were “new” and then “old,” and stating they represented
the man who gave the koro, but “there was no sign
meaning a man.” “He did not know that for ariki, the old men
did,” “the words were new, but the letters were old,” “each line
represented a koro.” An attempt to get him to reproduce any
tau made by himself was a failure. The answers, on the whole,
were so wandering and contradictory, that after a second visit
under those conditions, making five in all, the prospect of getting
anything further of material value did not seem sufficient to
justify the risks to others, however slight. As the last interview
drew to a close, I left the hut for a moment, and leant against
the wall outside, racking my brains to see if there was any
question left unasked, any possible way of getting at the information;
but most of what the old man knew he had forgotten,
and what he dimly remembered he was incapable of explaining.
I made one more futile effort, then bade him good-bye and
turned away. It was late afternoon on a day of unusual calm,
everything in the lonely spot was perfectly still, the sea lay
below like a sheet of glass, the sun as a globe of fire was nearing
the horizon, while close at hand lay the old man gradually
sinking, and carrying in his tired brain the last remnants of a
once-prized knowledge. In a fortnight he was dead.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>No detailed systematic study of the tablets has as yet been
possible from the point of view of the Expedition, but it seems
at present probable that the system was one of memory, and
that the signs were simply aids to recollection, or for keeping
count like the beads of a rosary. To what extent the figures
were used at will, or how far each was associated with a definite
idea it is impossible to say. Possibly there was no unvarying
method; certain ones may conveniently have been kept for an
ever-recurrent factor, as the host in the tau, and in well-known
documents, such as “he timo te ako-ako,” they would doubtless
be reproduced in orthodox succession. But in the tablets which
we possess the same figures are continually repeated, and the
fact that equivalents were always having to be found for new
names, as in that of the fish-man, or ika, suggest that they may
have been largely selected by the expert haphazard from a known
number. As Tomenika said, “the words were new, but the
letters were old,” or to quote Kapiera to the same effect, they
were “the same picture, but other words.” It will be noted how
few men are reported to have known each variety of rongo-rongo,
and that while Ngaara looked at the tablets of the boys, apparently
to see if they were properly cut, it was in the recitation only of
the older men that accuracy was insisted on. The names which
Bishop Jaussen’s informant assigned to some five hundred
figures may or may not be accurate, but whether the native or
anyone else could have stated what the signs conveyed is
another matter. It is easy to give the term for a knot in a
pocket-handkerchief, but no one save the owner can say
whether he wishes to remember to pay his life insurance or
the date of a tea-party.</p>

<p class='c007'>In trying to enter into the state of society and of mind which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>evolved the tablets there are two points worth noticing. Firstly,
the Islanders are distinctly clever with their hands and fond of
representing forms. Setting aside the large images, the carving
of the small wooden ones is very good, and the accuracy of the
tablet designs is wonderful. Then they have real enjoyment
in reciting categories of words; for example, in recounting folk-tales,
opportunity was always gleefully taken of any mention of
feasting to go through the whole of the food products of the island.
In the same way, if a hero went from one locality to another,
the name of every place <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> would be rolled out without any
further object than the mere pleasure of giving a string of names.
This form of recitation appears to affect them æsthetically, and
the mere continuation of sound to be a pleasure. Given, therefore,
that it was desired to remember lists of words, whether
categories of names or correct forms of prayer, the repetition
would be a labour of love, and to draw figures as aids to recollection
would be very natural.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, the signs themselves have no doubt a history,
which as such, even apart from interpretation, may prove to be
signposts in our search for the origin of this mysterious people.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Bird Cult</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Knowledge of the tablets was confined to a few, and formed
a comparatively small element of life in the island; the whole
of social existence revolved round the bird cult, and it was the
last of the old order to pass away. The main object of the
cult was to obtain the first egg of a certain migratory sea-bird,
and the rites were connected with the western headland, Rano
Kao. Little has yet been said of this volcano, but, from the
scenic point of view, it is the most striking portion of the island.
Its height is 1,300 feet, and it possesses a crater two-thirds of a
mile across, at the bottom of which is a lake largely covered with
weeds and plant life. On the eastward, or landward face, the
mountain, as already explained, slopes downward with a smooth
and grassy incline, and the other three sides have been worn by
the waves into cliffs over 1,000 feet in height. On the outermost
side the sea has nearly forced its way into the crater
itself; and the ocean is now divided from the lake at this point
by only a narrow edge, along which it would be possible but
not easy to walk with safety. At some near date, as geological
ages reckon, the island will have a magnificent harbour (figs. 100
and 108). Off this part of the coast are three little islets, outlying
portions of the original mountain, which have as yet withstood
the unceasing blows of the ocean. Their names are Motu Nui,
Motu Iti, and Motu Kao-kao, and on them nest the sea-birds
which have for unknown centuries played so important a part
in the history of the island. On the mainland, immediately
opposite these islets, there is on the top of the cliff a deserted
stone village; it is known as Orongo, and in it the Islanders
awaited the coming of the birds. It consists of nearly fifty
dwellings arranged in two rows, both facing the sea, and partly
overlapping; the lower row terminates just before the narrowest
part of the crater wall is reached. The final houses are built
among an outcrop of rocks; they are betwixt two groups of
stones, and have in front of them a small natural pavement.
The stones nearest the cliff look as if at any moment they might
join their brethren in headlong descent to the shore below (fig. 103).
Both the upstanding rocks and pavement are covered with
carvings; some of them are partly obliterated by time, and can
only be seen in a good light, but the ever-recurrent theme is a
figure with the body of a man and the head of a bird; portions
of the carvings are covered by the houses, and they therefore
antedate them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole position is marvellous, surpassing the wildest
scenes depicted in romance. Immediately at hand are these
strange relics of a mysterious past; on one side far beneath is
the dark crater lake; on the other, a thousand feet below,
swells and breaks the Pacific Ocean, it girdles the islets
with a white belt of foam, and extends, in blue unbroken
sweep, till it meets the ice-fields of the Antarctic. The all-pervading
stillness of the island culminates here in a silence
which may be felt, broken only by the cry of the sea-birds as
they circle round their lonely habitations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stone village formed the scene of some of our earliest work
during our first residence at the Manager’s house; for some
weeks, weather permitting, we rode daily up the mountain, an
ascent which took about fifty minutes, and spent the day on the
top studying the remains, and picking the brains of our native
companions. Some of the houses have been destroyed in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>to obtain the painted slabs within, but most are in fair, and
some in perfect, preservation. The form of construction suitable
to the low ground has perhaps been tried here and abandoned,
for some of the foundation-stones, pierced with the holes to
support the superstructure of stick and grass, are built into the
existing dwellings. The present buildings (fig. 104) are well
adapted to such a wind-swept spot; they are made of stone laminæ,
with walls about 6 feet thick; the inside walls are generally
lined with vertical slabs, and horizontal slabs form the roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greater number are built at the back into rising ground,
and their sides and top are covered with earth; the natives
call them not “haré,” or houses, but “ana,” or caves. Where
space permits it, the form is boat-shaped, but some have been
adapted to natural contours.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a> The dwellings vary in shape and
size, from 52 feet by 6 feet to 8 feet by 4 feet; the height
within varies from 4 feet to over 6 feet, but it is the exception
to be able to stand upright. In some cases they open out of
one another, and not unfrequently there is a hatch between two
through which food could be passed. The doorway, with its six
foot of passage, is just large enough to admit a man. Into each
of them, armed with ends of candles, we either crawled on hands
and knees, or wriggled like serpents, according to our respective
heights. The slabs lining the wall, which are just opposite the
doorway, and thus obtain a little light, are frequently painted;
some of them have bird and others native designs, but perhaps
the most popular is a European ship, sometimes in full sail,
and once with a sailor aloft in a red shirt (fig. 105). Inside the
houses we found the flat, sea-worn boulders which are used as
pillows and often incised with rough designs; there were also a
few obsidian spear-heads, or mataa, and once or twice sphagnum
from the crater, which was used for caulking boats, and also as
a sponge to retain fresh water when at sea. Outside many
of the doors are small stone-lined holes, which we cleared out
and examined. They measure roughly rather under 2 feet
across by some 15 inches in depth. Our guides first told us that
they were “ovens,” but, as no ash was found, it seems probable
that their second thoughts were right, and they were used to
contain stores.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>The groups of dwellings have various names, and are associated
with the particular clans, who, it is said, built them.
One house, which stands near the centre of the village, Taura-renga
by name, is particularly interesting as having been the
dwelling of the statue Hoa-haka-nanaia, roughly to be translated
as “Breaking wave,” now resident under the portico of the
British Museum (fig. 31). Lying about near by were two large
stones, which had originally served as foundations for the
thatched type of dwelling, but had apparently been converted
into doorposts for the house of the image; on one of them a
face had been roughly carved (fig. 107). The statue is not of
Raraku stone, and it will be realised how entirely exceptional it is
to find a statue under cover and in such a position. The back
and face were painted white, with the “tracings” in red. The
bottom contracts, and was embedded in the earth, though a stone
suspiciously like a pedestal is built into a near wall. The
house had to be broken down in order to get the figure out.
According to the account of the missionaries, three hundred
sailors and two hundred Kanakas were required to convey
it down the mountain to H.M.S. <em>Topaze</em> in Cook’s Bay. The
memory of the incident is fast fading, but our friend Viriamo
repeated in a quavering treble the song of the sailors as they
hauled down their load.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a> The figure is some eight feet high and
weighs about four tons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day by day, as we worked, we gazed down on the islets. The
outermost, which, as its name Motu Nui signifies, is also the
largest, is more particularly connected with the bird story,
which we were gradually beginning to grasp, and at last the call
to visit it could no longer be resisted (fig. 109). It was not an
easy matter, for <em>Mana</em> was away; the boats of the natives left a
good deal to be desired in the way of seaworthiness, and it was
only possible to make the attempt on a fine day. Finally, on
arrival at the island, it required not a little agility to jump on to
a ledge of rocks at the second the boat rose on the crest of the
waves, before it again sank on a boiling and surging sea till the
heads of the crew were many feet below the landing-place. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>managed, however, between us to get there three times in all.
Once, when I was there without S., there was an anxious moment
on re-embarking. No one quite knew what happened. Some
of the crew said that the gunwale of the boat, as she rose on a
wave, caught under an overhanging shelf of rock, others were of
the opinion that the sudden weight of the last man, who at
that moment leapt into the boat, upset her balance; anyway,
this tale was very nearly never written. Once landed on the
island, the surface is comparatively level and presents no difficulties;
it is about five acres in extent, the greater part is covered
with grass, and in every niche and cranny of the rock are sea-birds’
nests. By a large bribe of tobacco one of the most active
old men was induced to accompany us, and to point out the sites
of interest. Later, we followed up the story at Raraku, and so
little by little at many times, in divers places, and from various
people was gathered the story of the bird cult which follows.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not many sea-birds frequent this part of the Pacific, but on
Motu Nui some seven species find an abiding-place. Some stay
for the whole year, some come for the winter, and yet others for
the summer. Among the last is a kind known to the natives as
manu-tara<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a>; it arrives in September, the spring of the southern
hemisphere. The great object of life in Easter was to be the
first to obtain one of the newly laid eggs of this bird. It was
too solemn a matter for there to be any general scramble. Only
those who belonged to the clan in the ascendancy for the time
being could enter on the quest. Sometimes one group would
keep it in their hands for years, or they might pass it on to a
friendly clan. This selection gave rise, as might be expected,
to burnings of hearts; the matter might be, and probably often
was, settled by war. One year the Marama were inspired with
jealousy because the Miru had chosen the Ngaure as their
successors, and burnt down the house of Ngaara. This was,
perhaps, the beginning of the fray when the old Ariki was
carried off captive.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>The fortunate clan, or clans, for sometimes several combined,
left nothing to chance; in fact, as soon as one year’s egg had
been found, the incoming party made sure of their right of way
by taking up their abode at the foot of Rano Kao—namely, at
Mataveri. Here there were a number of the large huts with
stone foundations; in these they resided, with their wives and
families. One of our old gentlemen friends first saw the light
in a Mataveri dwelling, when his people were in residence, or, to
use the proper phraseology, when his clan were “the Ao.”<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c016'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
This name “ao” is also given to a large paddle, as much as
6 feet in length, used principally, if not exclusively, in connection
with bird rites and dancing at Mataveri. In some
specimens a face is fully depicted on the handle; in others the
features have degenerated to a raised line merely indicating the
eyebrows and nose. There are pictures of it on slabs in the
Orongo houses, in which the face is adorned with vertical stripes
of red and white after the native manner, as described by the
early voyagers (figs. 105 and 118).</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally the months passed at Mataveri were occupied
by the residents in feasting as well as in dancing, and equally
naturally the victims were human. It was to grace one of these
gatherings, when the Ureohei were the Ao, that the mother
of Hotu, the Miru, was slain in a way which he considered outraged
the decencies of life, and it was in revenge for another
Mataveri victim that the last statues were thrown down.
It is told that the destined provender for one meal evaded that
fate by hiding in the extreme end of a hut, which was so long
and dark that she was never found. Some of these repasts took
place in a cave in the sea-cliff near at hand. Here the ocean has
made great caverns in a wall of lava, into which the waves surge
and break with booming noise and dashing spray. The recess
which formed the banqueting-hall is just above high-water
mark, and is known as “Ana Kai-tangata,” or Eat-man Cave
(fig. 102). The roof is adorned with pictures of birds in red and
white; one of these birds is drawn over a sketch of a European
ship, showing that they are not of very ancient date (fig. 103).</p>

<p class='c007'>When July approached, the company, or some of them, wound
their way up the western side of the hill, along the ever-narrowing
summit to the village of Orongo; the path can just be
traced in certain lights, and is known as the “Road of the Ao.”
They spent their time while awaiting the birds in dancing each
day in front of the houses; food was brought up by the women,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>of whom Viriamo was one. The group of houses at the end
among the carved rocks was taboo during the festival, for they
were inhabited by the rongo-rongo men, the western half being
apportioned to the experts from Hotu Iti, the eastern to those
from Kotuu. “They chanted all day; they stopped an hour
to eat, that was all.” They came at the command of Ngaara,
but it is noteworthy that he himself never appeared at Orongo,
though he sometimes paid a friendly call at Mataveri.</p>

<p class='c007'>A short way down the cliff immediately below Orongo is a cave
known as “Haka-rongo-manu,” or “listening for the birds”;
here men kept watch day and night for news from the islet below.</p>

<p class='c007'>The privilege of obtaining the first egg was a matter of competition
between members of the Ao, but the right to be one of
the competitors was secured only by supernatural means. An
“ivi-atua,” a divinely gifted individual, of the kind who had
the gift of prophecy, dreamed that a certain man was favoured
by the gods, so that if he entered for the race he would be a
winner, or, in technical parlance, become a bird-man, or “tangata-manu.”
The victor, on being successful, was ordered to
take a new name, which formed part of the revelation, and this
bird-name was given to the year in which victory was achieved,
thus forming an easily remembered system of chronology. The
nomination might be taken up at once or not for many years;
if not used by the original nominee, it might descend to his son or
grandson. If a man did not win, he might try again, or say that
“the ivi-atua was a liar,” and retire from the contest. Women
were never nominated, but the ivi-atua might be male or female,
and, needless to say, was rewarded with presents of food. There
were four “gods” connected with the eggs—Hawa-tuu-také-také,
who was “chief of the eggs,” and Maké-maké, both of whom
were males; there were also two females, Vie Hoa, the wife of
Hawa, and Vie Kenatea. Each of these four had a servant,
whose names were given, and who were also supernatural beings.
Those going to take the eggs recited the names of the gods before
meat, inviting them to partake.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>The actual competitors were men of importance, and spent
their time with the remainder of the Ao in the stone houses of
the village of Orongo; they selected servants to represent
them and await the coming of the birds in less comfortable
quarters in the islet below. These men, who were known as
“hopu,” went to the islet when the Ao went up to Orongo, or
possibly rather later. Each made up his provisions into a
“pora,” or securely bound bundle of reeds; he then swam on
the top of the packet, holding it with one arm and propelling
himself with the remaining arm and both legs. An incantation,
which was recited to us, was said by him before starting. In
one instance, the ivi-atua, at the same time that he gave the
nomination, prophesied that the year that it was taken up a
man should be eaten by a large fish. The original recipient
never availed himself of it, but on his death-bed told his son of
the prophecy. The son, Kilimuti, undeterred by it, entered for
the race and sent two men to the islet; one of them started to
swim there with his pora, but was never heard of again, and it
was naturally said that the prophecy had been fulfilled. Kilimuti
wasted no regret over the misfortune, obtained another
servant, and secured the egg; he died while the Expedition was
on the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hopu lived together in a large cave of which the entrance
is nearly concealed by grass. The inside, however, is
light and airy; it measures 19 feet by 13, with a height of over
5 feet, and conspicuous among other carvings in the centre of
the wall is a large ao more than 7 feet in length. A line dividing
the islet between Kotuu and Hotu Iti passed through the centre
of the cave, and also through another cave nearer the edge
of the islet; in this latter there was at one time a statue about
2 feet high known as Titahanga-o-te-henua, or The Boundary
of the Land.<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c016'><sup>[62]</sup></a> As bad weather might prevent fresh consignments
of food during the weeks of waiting, the men carefully dried on
the rocks the skins of the bananas and potatoes which they had
brought with them, to be consumed in case of necessity. It
was added with a touch appreciated by those acquainted with
Easter Island, that, if the man who thus practised foresight
was not careful, others who had no food would steal it when he
was not looking.</p>

<p class='c007'>The approach of the manu-tara can be heard for miles, for
their cry is their marked peculiarity, and the noise during nesting
is said to be deafening; one incised drawing of the bird shows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>it with open beak, from which a series of lines spreads out fanwise,
obviously representing the volume of sound; names in
imitation of these sounds were given to children, such as “Pir-uru,”
“Wero-wero,” “Ka-ara-ara.” It is worth noting that
the coming of the tara inaugurates the deep-sea fishing season;
till their arrival all fish living in twenty or thirty fathoms were
considered poisonous. The birds on first alighting tarried only
a short time; immediately on their departure the hopu rushed
out to find the egg, or, according to another account, the rushing
out of the hopu frightened away the birds. The gods intervened
in the hunt, so that the man who was not destined to win went
past the egg even when it lay right in his path. The first finder
rushed up to the highest point of the islet, calling to his employer
by his new name, “Shave your head, you have got the egg.”
The cry was taken up by the watchers in the cave on the mainland,
and the fortunate victor, beside himself with joy, proceeded
to shave his head and paint it red, while the losers showed their
grief by cutting themselves with mataa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The defeated hopu started at once to swim from the
island to the shore, while the winner, who was obliged to fast
while the egg was in his possession, put it in a little basket, and,
going down to the landing-rock, dipped it into the sea. One meaning
of the word hopu is “wash.” He then tied the basket round
his forehead and was able to swim quickly, as the gods were
with him. At this stage sometimes accidents occurred, for if
the sea was rough, an unlucky swimmer might be dashed on the
rocks and killed. In one instance, it was said, only one man
escaped with his life, owing, as he reported, to his having been
warned by Maké-maké not to make the attempt. When the
hopu arrived on the mainland, he handed over the egg to his
employer, and a tangata-rongo-rongo tied round the arm which
had taken it a fragment of red tapa and also a piece of the tree
known as “ngau-ngau,” reciting meanwhile the appropriate
words. The finding was announced by a fire being lit on the
landward side of the summit of Rano Kao on one of two sites,
according to whether the Ao came from the west or east side
of the island.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>It will be remembered that on the rocks which terminate the
settlement of Orongo the most numerous of the carvings is the
figure of a man with the head of a bird; it is in a crouching
attitude with the hands held up, and is carved at every size and
angle according to the surface of the rock (fig. 110). It can still
be counted one hundred and eleven times, and many specimens
must have disappeared: all knowledge of its meaning is lost.
The figure may have represented one of the egg gods, but it
seems more probable that each one was a memorial to a bird-man;
and this presumption is strengthened by the fact that in
at least three of the carvings the hand is holding an egg (fig. 112).
The history of another figure, a small design which is also very
frequent, still survives and corroborates this by analogy; within
living memory it was the custom for women of the island to
come up here and be immortalised by having one of these small
figures (“Ko Mari”) cut on the rock by a professional expert.
We know, therefore, that conventional forms were used as
memorials of certain definite persons.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c016'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The bird-man, having obtained the egg, took it in his hand
palm upwards, resting it on a piece of tapa, and danced with a
rejoicing company down the slope of Rano Kao and along the
south coast, a procedure which is known as “haka epa,” or
“make shelf,” from the position of the hand with regard to the
egg. If, however, the winner belonged to the western clans, he
generally went to Anakena for the next stage, very possibly
because, as was explained, he was afraid to go to Hotu Iti; some
victors also went to special houses in their own district, otherwise
the company went along the southern shore till they reached
Rano Raraku.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amongst the statues standing on its exterior slope, there is
shown at the south-west corner the foundations of a house (no. 7,
fig. 60). This is the point which would first be approached
from the southern coast, and here the bird-man remained for a
year, five months of which were spent in strict taboo. The egg,
which was still kept on tapa, was hung up inside the house and
blown on the third day, a morsel of tapa being put inside.
The victor did not wash, and spent his time in “sleeping all day,
only coming out to sit in the shade.” His correct head-dress
was a crown made of human hair; it was known as “hau oho,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>and if it was not worn the aku-aku would be angry. The house
was divided into two, the other half being occupied by a man
who was called an ivi-atua, but was of an inferior type to the
one gifted with prophecy, and apparently merely a poor relation
of the hero; there were two cooking-places, as even he might
not share that of the bird-man. Food was brought as gifts,
especially the first sugar-cane, and these offerings seem to have
been the sole practical advantage of victory; those who did
not contribute were apt to have their houses burnt. The bird-man’s
wife came to Raraku, but dwelt apart, as for the first five
months she could not enter her husband’s house, nor he hers, on
pain of death. A few yards below the bird-man’s house is the ahu
alluded to on p. 191 (fig. 60); it consists merely of a low rough
wall built into the mountain, the ground above it being levelled
and paved. It was reserved for the burial of bird-men; they were
the uncanny persons whose ghosts might do unpleasant things—they
were safer hidden under stones. The name Orohié is given
to the whole of this corner of the mountain, with its houses, its
ahu, and its statues. To this point the figures led which
were round the base of the hill. If they were re-erected, they
would stand with their backs not to the mountain, but to Orohié.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c016'><sup>[64]</sup></a>
As the bird-man gazed lazily forth from the shade of his house,
above him were the quarries with their unfinished work, below
him were the bones of his dead predecessors, while on every
hand giant images stood for ever in stolid calm. It is difficult
to escape from the question, Were the statues on the mountain
those of bird-men?</p>

<p class='c007'>The hopu also retired into private life; if he were of the Ao, he
could come to Orohié, but he might, if he wished, reside in his
own house, which was in that case divided by a partition through
which food was passed; it might not be eaten with his right
hand, as that had taken the egg. His wife and children were
also kept in seclusion and forbidden to associate with others.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new Ao had meanwhile taken up their abode at Mataveri.
From here a few weeks after their arrival they went formally to
Motu Nui to obtain the young manu-tara, known from their
cry as “piu.” After the brief visit of the birds when the first
egg was laid, they absented themselves from the islet for a period
varyingly reported as from three days to a month. On their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>return they laid plentifully, and, as soon as the nestlings were
hatched, the men of the celebrating clan carried them to the
mainland, swimming with them in baskets bound round the
forehead after the manner of the first egg. They were then
taken in procession round the island, or, according to another
account, only as far as Orohié. It was not until the piu
had been obtained that it was permissible to eat the eggs, and
they were then consumed by the subservient clans only, not by
the Ao. The first two or three eggs, it was explained, were
“given to God”; to eat them would prove fatal. Some of the
young manu-tara were kept in confinement till they were full
grown, when a piece of red tapa was tied round the wing and
leg, and they were told, “Kaho ki te hiva,” “Go to the world
outside.” There was no objection to eating the young birds.
The tara departed from Motu Nui about March, but a few stragglers
remained; we saw one bird and obtained eggs at the
beginning of July, but the natives failed to get any for us in
August. When in the following spring the new bird-man had
achieved his egg, he brought it to Orohié and was given the old
one, which he buried in a gourd in a cranny of Rano Raraku;
sometimes, however, it was thrown into the sea, or kept and
buried with its original owner. The new man then took the
place of his predecessor, who returned to ordinary life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last year that the Ao went to Orongo, which is known
as “Rokunga,” appears to have been 1866 or 1867. The names
of twelve subsequent years are given, during which the competition
for the egg continued, and it was still taken to be interred
at Raraku. The cult thus survived in a mutilated form the
conversion of the island to Christianity, which was completed
in 1868; it is said that once the missionaries saw the Ao dancing
with the egg outside their door in Hanga Roa and “told the
people it was the Devil.” It must have been celebrated even
after the assembly of the remains of the clans into one place,
which occurred about the same time, but it was finally crushed
by the secular exploiters of the island, whose house at Mataveri,
that of the present manager, rests on the foundation-stones of
the cannibal habitation (fig. 25). The cult admittedly degenerated
in later years. A new practice arose of having more
than one bird-man, with other innovations. The request to
be given the names of as many bird-years as could be remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>met with an almost embarrassing response, eighty-six being
quoted straight away; some of these may be the official names
of bird-men and not represent a year, but they probably do so
in most cases; chronological sequence was achieved with fair
certainty for eleven years prior to the final celebration at Orongo.
In addition to the bird-name, the names of both winner and
hopu were ascertained, with those of their respective clans.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Two other ceremonies were mentioned in connection with
Orongo and Motu Nui, but to obtain detailed information
was very difficult. It finally transpired that of “také” no first-hand
knowledge existed, as the rites had been abandoned
thirty years before the coming of the missionaries. All
that can be safely said is that those concerned went into
retreat on Motu Nui, living, it was stated, in the cave
where the hopu awaited the birds; the period was generally
given as three months. A vigorous discussion took place on
the subject between Viriamo and Jotefa, the oldest man
in the village, seated on a log in the garden of the old lady.
She was positive, in agreement with other authorities, that
také was for children—“the boys and girls went in a canoe to
the island”; he firmly adhered to the statement that his father
went for také, after he, the son, was born. Tomenika stated that
také formed the subject of one of the tablets, and drew one of its
figures, which bears no resemblance to any other known symbol.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>The details of manu were more satisfactory. It was known as
“te manu mo te poki,” or, “the bird for the child,” and the
child so initiated became a “poki-manu,” or “bird-child.” It
could not be found that any special benefit resulted from it, but
a child whose parents had not performed the ceremony, and
whose love affairs, for instance, went wrong, might even kill his
father in revenge for the omission. An expert, known as “tangata-tapa-manu,”
the man who, as Dr. Marett would tell us,
“knew the right things to say,” was called in and given a hen’s
egg—on this last point much stress was laid; he was at the
same time told the child’s name, which was subsequently inserted
in the ritual. The child was shaved, decorated with white bands,
and hung round with coconuts, or, as these were not readily
obtainable in Easter Island, with pieces of wood carved to
represent them called “tahonga.” A number of children, each
with an expert, then went up to Orongo; the correct month
was December, and the Ao were therefore below at Mataveri.
Jotefa, on whose final account I principally rely, stated that he
and nine other children, with their parents, and ten tangata-tapa-manu,
went to Orongo from his home on the north coast, a
distance of some eleven miles; they took with them ten chickens.
The party danced in front of all the houses, went to the carved
rocks at the end, and, coming back, stood in a semicircle in front
of the door of Taura-renga, the house of the statue, the experts
being behind and all singing; no offering was made to the
image. Another authority stated that the parents and children
went on the roof of the house, the experts being below, and the
parents gave chickens to the men. Jotefa’s party returned to
their home, had a feast, and gave more food to the professionals.
The tangata-tapa-manu subsequently repeated the ritual at any
koro which were being held in the island, the object apparently
being to make public the child’s initiation.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, by reason of the state of the island, it was not possible
to go to Orongo, the ceremony could take place at any of
the big ahu with images. Viriamo, whose home, as will be
remembered, was near Raraku, said with much pride that she
was a “poki-manu”; she and her three younger sisters had
been taken at the same time to the ahu of Orohié. Both parents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>went, and the mother took two chickens, one in each hand,
and the mother and children stood upright and the “maori sang”;
they did not go to Orongo because there was war. A drawing
was made for us by Juan and the old men of the poki-manu in
ceremonial attire (fig. 114); it was particularly interesting to
find, when it was handed in, that circles of white pigment were
made on the child’s back, and also on each buttock, in a way
which recalls the adornment of the Anakena image (fig. 65).</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Wooden Carvings</span></h4>

<p class='c024'>The stone sculpture of Easter Island belongs to an era which
is now forgotten; there are a number of wooden carvings which,
whatever their original age, are connected with a recent past,
and even in a limited sense with the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important of these works, the tablets, have
already been dealt with, and mention has been made of the
lizard figures, they have the head of that animal on a human
body (fig. 117). The “ao,” the large dancing-paddle, and
the smaller one, the “rapa,” are of much the same
character, though used on different occasions (figs. 116 (<em>a</em>), 118).
The “ua” is a club, on the handle of which are two
heads back to back; these clubs were dignified with individual
names. The “paoa” was a wooden sword. There were also
bird ornaments carved in wood which were worn on the last
day of the koro and by Ngaara. The “rei-miro” is a breast
ornament of a crescent shape, with a face at one or both ends;
it is found depicted on the Orongo rocks and frequently on the
tablets. It was especially a woman’s decoration, but a number
of small ones were said to have been worn by Ngaara. The
specimen in the British Museum is embellished with glyphs, of
which no account was forthcoming (fig. 115).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Wooden objects which are peculiarly interesting are the
small male and female figures some twenty to thirty inches
in height; the natives term them “moai,” adding the word
“miro,” or wood (fig. 119). In a certain number of these the
ribs are very prominent, giving the effect of emaciation; they are
called “moai kava-kava,” or the statues with ribs. It has been
suggested that this represents the condition in which the first
inhabitants reached the island, but such an explanation is
strenuously denied by the present people, who assert that their
ancestors arrived with plenty of food. The figures have long
ears, like the statues in stone, and a marked feature is their little
goatee beards. These beards are found in three or four statues
at Raraku, in a head in relief on Motu Nui, and one is indicated
in fig. 31. But the most striking link with the stone figures
is the back, where there is a ring similar to that found on the
larger statues: the girdle and M-like design below it also appear
in varying degree (fig. 120). A comparative study of the backs
of the wooden images has suggested the idea<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a> that this M-like
marking in stone may be simply the last stage of an evolution
in design, which originally showed the lines of the lower portion
of the back and thigh.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c016'><sup>[66]</sup></a> It would be satisfactory if, in the same
way, the triple belt could be connected with the ribs and the
ring with the vertebræ, but for this the evidence is less conclusive,
although the ribs of the body with the lizard head closely
approach the conventional. It must be remembered that the
figures are nude, and that therefore these designs can scarcely
represent any form of dress. There is a pronounced excrescence
on the buttocks in the wooden figures, which is also a mystery,
but which recalls the way in which the rings on the image
found at Anakena (fig. 65) and those on the poki-manu (fig. 114)
emphasise the same part of the anatomy. The heads are embellished
with ornaments, some of which are bird designs
(fig. 121). These figures were worn by men only, and hung
round the neck on important occasions; they were parts of
the festival dress at Mataveri and at the koro.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tradition of the origin of the wooden images is one of the
best known and uniformly narrated, but obviously bears the
marks of endeavouring to explain facts whose genesis has been
forgotten. It runs thus: Tuukoihu, an ariki, and one of the first
immigrants, was a clever man or “tangata-maori”; he had two
houses, one at Ahu Tepeu on the west side and one at Hanga
Hahavé on the south coast—the foundations of both are shown.
One night, when he was sleeping at the latter dwelling, two
female aku-aku appeared to him, by name Papa Ahiro and Papa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Akirani.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a> When he awoke he took the wood called toro-miro,
and carved two figures with faces, arms, and legs, just as he had
seen the aku-aku. When he had finished the work, he went over
to Hanga Roa to fish. He slept there, and returned at daybreak,
going back by the quarry of the stone hats. Two male aku-aku,
by name Ko Hitirau and Ko Nuku-te-mangoa, were sleeping
by the way, but were aroused on his approach by two more
aku-aku, whose names are given, who told them that there was
a man coming who would notice that their ribs were exceedingly
“bad.” The two sleepers awoke, saw Tuukoihu, and asked
him, “Have you seen anything?” He discreetly replied “nothing,”
and they disappeared. They again met him on the
road and put the same question, to which he gave the same
answer. When he got to his house, he made two statues with
ribs to represent the apparitions. After dark they prowled
round the house, listening, with their hands up to their ears, to
hear if he gossiped about what he had seen, intending if he did
so to kill him. The Ariki, however, held his tongue. Later he
went to his other home; there he took the wooden moai, both
male and female, and made them walk. The house bears the
lengthy name of “The House of the Walking Moai of Tuukoihu,
the Ariki,” and is the large one whose measurements were given
on p. 216. Tuukoihu once lent a moai-miro to a man, whose
house took fire while it was in his possession. The Ariki,
on hearing of the disaster, told the image to fly away, which it
promptly did, and was subsequently found in the neighbourhood
unharmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wooden figures are said to have been made in a considerable
variety of forms, some of them being in a sitting position, others
with hands crossed, etc.; names were bestowed on them—twenty-one
such were repeated to us. It was not found possible to
ascertain exactly what they are all intended to portray, the
information being somewhat confused and contradictory, but
on the whole the female figures and those with ribs seem to have
been considered to be supernatural beings; they are generally
called aku-aku, and sometimes atua, while the others represent
men. It appears probable that they are portraits, or memorial
figures, of which the older may have attained to deification:
this is confirmed by the fact that there is one such figure at the
Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford, with short ears, which is said
to have been made to represent Captain Cook.</p>

<p class='c007'>When our friend Kapiera was a boy, there were about ten
experts in the island, who made wooden articles of various descriptions,
including the images, of whom three at least were
alive in our time. Te Haha, who was one of the old workmen,
could still be seen sitting in his garden engaged in carving moai
miro. We have, therefore, a craft existing in modern days
which can be traced back to pre-Christian culture, and which has
strong affinities with the prehistoric stone figures. There is,
of course, no sentiment connected
with the figures of to-day; they
are roughly done, and merely for
sale. The trade is extended to
copies of stone images which are
bought by unsuspecting visitors,
with circumstantial tales as to
their history or discovery which
would deceive the very elect. The
statues on the ahu near the village,
which are made of stone from
Raraku, have had pieces cut off
them to manufacture into these
articles. One Kanaka had in our
day a still more brilliant idea
which saved him all trouble, he
sold a fragment of this rock at a
high price to a passing vessel as the “last morsel of image stone to
be found in the island.” Local opinion regarding the intelligence
of the visitors is not high. One man brought to us a wooden
figure for sale which he said was “very old.” “Indeed,” remarked
my husband, “it has grown up quickly; it was a
new-born infant when I saw it being carved in the village a
few weeks ago.” “Ah,” said the proud possessor, slightly
disappointed, but nursing his creation like a child and stroking
it affectionately, “he very fine, muy antiqua, I keep him for
ships; capitano man-o-wari, all same damn fool.”</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>Residential Caves—Caves as Hiding-Places for Treasure—Burial Caves.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Easter Island, from its geological formation, is a land of underground
cavities; between the harder volcanic strata lie softer
deposits, which have been gradually washed away, either by
subterraneous streams or, as in certain localities round the
coast, by the action of the waves, leaving above and below the
more durable substance. There are thus formed grottoes and
crannies innumerable; they were used, as has been seen, for
sleeping-places and for burial, and they also came in handy as
treasure deposits. Large caves are comparatively rare, though
in one district underground ways filled with water extend to a
great length, and the whole surface rings hollow to the tread of
a horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>We daily examined such caves and grottoes as came under
our notice; and systematically excavated some half-dozen, which
had apparently been used in former days as native habitations.
Below the floor of one, Mr. Edmunds had already discovered a
small chamber walled and roofed with slabs, which the natives
said had been used as a place of hiding in cannibal days; but
generally the earth deposit is very shallow, and the yields were
the same only as those of the houses at Orongo, a few spear
heads, bone needles, and sea-shells whose contents had been
used for food. There were few objects among the natives
which lent themselves to preservation for any length of time;
they never made pottery, although there is clay in the island;
wooden articles would generally rot, and they had no form of
metal. This reflection reconciled us in some degree to what
was otherwise a disappointment, our inability to reach the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>most thrilling of the caves, which are half-way up the great
sea-cliffs; they can be seen from the ocean, and are known to
have been used, but the original track has either been washed
away by the encroaching waves or lies in a tumbled mass on the
beach below. A special voyage was made round the island in
<em>Mana</em> with the object of studying these caves; some of
the Expedition went in the yacht, and signalled their situation
to a second party, who rode along the coast and placed marks
on the cliff as a guide for subsequent exploration. We finally,
however, gave up the idea of attempting to reach them; it
would have been possible, no doubt, to have done so from the
top, with a rope and experienced climbers, but a certain amount
of danger would have been inevitably involved, and, considering
the smallness of our numbers and the circumstances, we felt it
unwise to take the risk of accident. We do not believe, in view
of our experience elsewhere, that they are likely to contain
anything of material value, but, in any case, they remain unrifled
for our successors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Articles which were considered of value by the owners were
kept, not in these larger caves, but in little holes and crannies
where they could be easily concealed. This practice still continues,
both for legitimate and illegitimate purposes; it made
it, for example, impossible to trace the stores which were stolen
soon after our arrival. The natives are naturally secretive,
and do not confide the whereabouts of their hiding-places, so
that when a man dies his hoard is lost. One old leper, who was
said to have some five tablets, reported to his friends that
when Mr. Edmunds was making a wall on the estate, the
men went so near his cache that he was in momentary dread of
its discovery, but they passed it by; he died soon after, and all
knowledge of it was lost. The most tragic story is the authenticated
one of a man who disappeared with his secret store. He
had been bargaining with visitors, and went to fetch for sale
some of his hidden possessions; he was never heard of again.
Presumably some accident happened, and he either fell down a
cliff or was buried alive. Sometimes a man on his death-bed
will give directions to his son as to where things are hidden, but
natural landmarks alter, and this information seems seldom
sufficient to enable the place to be recognised; treasure-hunting
on Easter Island is therefore a most disappointing pursuit, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>we found to our cost. Soon after our arrival a man died in the
village who was said to have things hidden among the rocks in
a part of the coast not far from the village. His neighbours
turned out to dig. We offered high rewards for anything found,
which were to be doubled if the objects were left untouched till
our arrival on the scene, and we wasted much time ourselves
superintending the search, but nothing appeared. A young
man volunteered the information that he had a cave on Rano
Kao where his father had hidden things, and another half-day
was spent in riding to the spot; the whereabouts had only been
described generally, and he could not find the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet another day we rode round the eastern headland to find
some stone statues, the locality of which had been confided to
Juan by the old man Kilimuti, who was a member of his family.
The search was again in vain, and Juan indignantly characterised
his ancient relative as “a liar.” An interesting, but equally
futile, expedition was made to look for a tablet, said to have
been hidden by a rongo-rongo man near Anakena; the cave in
this case proved to have an entrance like a well, artificially built
up, and to be a long, natural, subterranean chamber. There were
certain traces which might have been those of decayed wood,
but nothing more. We subsequently discovered that this sort
of thing is usual; the natives possess, not “castles in Spain,”
but caves in certain localities which they speak of definitely as
“theirs,” but which are quite as reluctant to materialise as any
southern château.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Edmunds assured us, with amused sympathy, that his
initial experiences and disillusionment had been precisely
similar to our own. The natives themselves, nevertheless,
continue to hunt with undiminished zeal for these hidden articles,
whose value is well known; it is the one form of work which
they enjoy. Rumour had come from Tahiti, shortly before we
reached the island, that articles were hidden in a recess in the
coast not far from the Cannibal Cave; the whole place was dug
over and ransacked by treasure-hunters from the village, without
result so far as we ever heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Caves were frequently used as places of burial. Generally, as
in the case of Ko Tori, an isolated corpse was placed in a grotto,
but on Motu Nui we came across two subterranean chambers
which had been definitely prepared as vaults. One of these had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>obviously not been visited for some time, as a considerable
amount of clearance had to be effected before it could be reached.
The entrance proved to be a small, properly constructed doorway,
two feet high and eleven inches in width, from which a short
passage descended at a sharp angle. To wriggle down this
narrow way felt much like a rabbit going into a burrow. The
cave below proved to be a circular vault, under ten feet in diameter.
Four corpses lay side by side on the floor, while a fifth
had been hurriedly shoved in, head foremost, through the doorway
above. The ceiling and walls were artificially made and
covered with white pigment. On the walls were three heads,
carved in relief, the only ones encountered; they were adorned
with touches of red paint. The one which was best wrought
was twenty inches in length, and projected some two to three
inches from the surface of the wall; it had a pronounced “imperial.”
The sides of the cave were also adorned with incised
drawings of birds. In order to copy these carvings by the light
of a small candle, it was necessary to encamp among the damp
mould of the floor in contact with the remains of the dead. The
proceeding felt not a little gruesome, even to a now hardened
anthropologist, and the return to daylight was very welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other cave on the islet was very similar, but smaller in
size, and the carvings were not so good. The corpses which it
contained had evidently been buried in tapa. No information
of special interest was forthcoming to account for these burials
on Motu Nui; if they were associated with any particular family
or class the fact has been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>The custom is said to have existed of enclosing such articles
as chisels and fish-hooks in the wrappings of a corpse, and it is
recorded that the bird-man’s egg sometimes accompanied him
to his last home; the idea also of placing her <em>prie-Dieu</em> in
Angata’s grave seemed to be a survival of such a practice. With
the one exception, however, of the beads in the canoe-shaped
ahu, we never found any objects with the dead. The natives
who were generally most anxious to reach the inaccessible caves
in the hope of treasure, felt no interest in one which can be
seen from below to have a wall across the mouth, and which was
said to be a place of burial; they considered that it would contain
nothing of value. It seems therefore probable that belongings
buried with the deceased were speedily stolen and have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>not been available in the memory of this generation. It is
difficult to suppose that any fear of punishment here or hereafter
would deter an Easter Islander from appropriating any such
article for which he had a fancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>There may still be accidental discoveries in grottoes of forgotten
hoards, or a few things treasured in this way by old men
may be disclosed, but personally we are persuaded that the secret
of this land must be sought elsewhere than in its caves.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>First Arrival on the Island—The Long Ears exterminated by the Short Ears—The Struggle between Kotuu and Hotu Iti.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It remains to be seen what accounts the islanders give of their
origin and history in addition to the vague fragments already
quoted. These legends fall into three groups, which, though
they touch at some points, are in reality separate, and their
relation to one another in point of time cannot be certainly
ascertained. It need hardly be said that, like all such legends,
they cannot be regarded as more than suggestive; when the
mysteries have been solved, it will no doubt be easy to see where
they have been founded on fact, and where error has crept in,
and essential points distorted or forgotten; meanwhile, the clues
they afford can only be partial. These groups deal respectively,
firstly with the arrival of the islanders under Hotu-matua;
secondly with the destruction of the Long Ears; and thirdly
with the war between the two sides of the island, Kotuu and
Hotu Iti. The stories have necessarily been somewhat abbreviated.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>First Arrival on the Island</span></h4>

<p class='c024'>The ancestors of the present inhabitants came, it is said, from
two neighbouring islands known as Marae Renga and Marae
Tohio. Here, on the death of the chief, Ko Riri-ka-atea, a
struggle for supremacy arose between his two sons, Ko Te Ira-ka-atea
and Hotu-matua, in which Hotu was defeated. Now there
was on one of the islands a certain Haumaka, who had tattooed
Hotu, and received from him in return a present of mother-of-pearl
which had been given to Hotu’s father by an individual
called Tuhu-patoea. Tuhu had seen that the men who went
down to get pearls were eaten by a big fish, so he invented a net
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>by which the precious shell could be obtained without risk, and
the pearl so procured he had presented to his chief, Ko Riri.
This man, Haumaka, had a dream, and during it his spirit went
to a far country, and when he awoke he told six men, whose
names are given, to go and seek for it; they were to look for a
land where there were three islets and a big hole, also a long
and beautiful road. So the six men went, each on a piece of
wood, and they found the three islets, Motu Nui, Motu Iti,
Motu Kao-kao, and the big hole, which was the crater of Rano
Kao. They landed on that part of the island and planted yams,
and then walked round the island, beginning by the south
coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were near Anakena, one of them, Ira, saw a turtle
and tried to take it, but it was too heavy for him to lift, so the
other five went to help, but it was still too heavy for them, and it
struck out and injured one named Kuku; he was taken to a
neighbouring cave and begged the others not to leave him, but
his companions made five cairns outside the cave<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c016'><sup>[68]</sup></a> and departed,
and Kuku died in the cave. The men went to Hanga Roa and
on to Orongo. A sixth man then appeared on the scene, but
whence he came is not known, and the other five told him
that “this was a bad land,” for when they had planted yams,
grass had grown up. Then the men went to Motu Nui and slept
there, and in the morning, when they woke, two boats were seen
approaching. The vessels were bound together, but as they
came near the land the cord which united them was cut. The
name of the one boat was “Oteka,” and in it were Hotu-matua
and his wife, Vakai-a-hiva; and the name of the other boat was
“Oua,” and in it were a certain Hinelilu and his wife, Avarepua.
Ira called to them, and told them also that “this was a bad
land”; to which Hotu-matua replied that they too came from
a bad land, “when the sea is low we die few, when the sea is
high we die many.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the boats divided, and Hotu-matua went round the
south and east coasts, and Hinelilu by the west and north.
Hotu wished to be the first to reach Anakena, which the previous
arrivals had told him was a good place to land, so when he saw
the other vessel approaching, he “said to himself a word,” which
made his own boat go fast and Hinelilu’s go slow; so he got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>first to the cove. A son was born there to Vakai and named
Ko Tuumaheke. Hinelilu was a man of intelligence, and wrote
rongo-rongo on paper he brought with him. Amongst those
who came in the boats was the ariki Tuukoihu, the maker of the
wooden images; two of his sons and two grandsons have given
their names to four subdivisions of the Miru clan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among Hotu-matua’s company there was a concealed passenger
whose name was Oroi; he was an enemy of Hotu, who
had killed his children in the place whence they came, and had
hidden himself on board. He got on shore at Anakena, without
anyone having guessed at his presence, and killed everyone.
One day the five children of a man named Aorka went to bathe
at Owaihi, a small cove east of Anakena, and as they lay on a
rock in the sea, Oroi came from behind and killed them and took
out their insides. When they did not return, the father said to
the mother, “Where are the children?” The mother said,
“On the rock”; but when Aorka went to look, the rock was
covered with water, for it was high tide; when by and by the
water went down, he saw the five children and that they were
dead. Aorka then told Hotu-matua: “Oroi, that bad man, is
here, for he has killed my children.” Now Hotu-matua went
to see his daughter who was married, and as he went Oroi put a
noose in his path and tried to catch his foot in it, but Hotu
stepped on one side. When he had finished his visit to his
daughter, he said to her and her husband, “Follow me as I go
home.” And as he returned he saw that the cord was still there,
and his enemy hidden behind the rock. This time Hotu-matua
intentionally stepped on to the rope and fell, and when Oroi
came up, he got hold of him and killed him, and then called to
his daughter and son-in-law to see that he was dead. When,
however, they put the corpse in the oven to cook him he came
to life again, so they had to take him over to the other side of
the island to where the ahu is called Oroi (fig. 122), and there
he cooked quite satisfactorily, and they ate him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hotu-matua had many sons from whom the different clans
are descended, and whose names they bear. He quarrelled with
the eldest, Tuumaheki, and with his own wife, Vakai; the two
having behaved badly to him, he finally gave up his position
to Tuumaheki and retired to the top of Rano Kao, where he
lived on the south side of the crater, that opposite to Orongo.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>He was old and blind and became also very ill; his elder sons
came to see him, but he kept asking for Hotu-iti, the youngest,
who was his favourite. When Marama appeared, the old man
felt the calf of his leg, and said, “You are not Hotu-iti, you are
Marama; where is Hotu-iti?” Koro-orongo answered as if
he were Hotu-iti, and said, “I am here,” but he lied, and his
father took hold of his leg, and said again, “You are not Hotu-iti”;
and the same thing happened with Ngaure, and Raa, and
Hamea, and the others; and at last came Hotu-iti, and Hotu-matua
knew him, for he was small, and his leg was slight, and
said to him, “You are Hotu-iti, of Mata-iti, and your descendants
shall prosper and survive all others.” And he said to Kotuu,
“You are Kotuu, of Mata-nui, and your descendants shall
multiply like the shells of the sea, and the reeds of the crater, and
the pebbles of the beach, but they shall die and shall not remain.”
And when he had said this he left his house, and went along to
the cliff where the edge of the crater is narrowest, and stood on
it by two stones, and he looked over the islet of Motu Nui towards
Marae Renga, and called to four aku-aku in his old home
across the sea, “Kuihi, Kuaha, Tongau, Opakako, make the
cock crow for me,” and the cock crew in Marae Renga, and he
heard it across the sea; that was his death signal, so he said to
his sons, “Take me away.” So they took him back to his house,
and he died. Thus Hotu-matua came to his end and was buried
at Akahanga.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of the gods of Marae Renga, who were the ancestors of
Hotu-matua, came with him in his boat, and he knew they were
there though the others did not see them. The names of eleven
of them were given, four of which were independently quoted
as amongst the aku-aku associated with Akahanga.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Story of the Long Ears</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Now the Long Ears (“Hanau Epé”) and Short Ears (“Hanau
Momoku”) lived together mixed up all over the land, but one of
the Long Ears, Ko Ita by name, who lived at Orongo, had in
his house the bodies of thirty boys, whom he had killed to eat.
Among his victims were the seven sons of one man, Ko Pepi.
Ko Pepi went mad, and ran round and round till he fell down, and
his brothers took their mataa and killed the Long Ears at Vinapu
and at Orongo. They were joined by the other Short Ears, till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>the Long Ears took refuge in the eastern headland, across which
they then dug a ditch and filled it with brushwood in order to
make a fire in self-defence. Now a body of the Short Ears
were drawn up in array in front of the ditch, but another party
were shown the way round at night by an old woman, and thus
turned their flank; so when morning dawned the Long Ears
found themselves attacked both from behind and before, and
then were swept into the ditch of their own making.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a> There they
were all burnt except two, who made their way to a cave, near
Anakena, where they hid, but they were dug out of it and
killed, calling aloud “Oroini,” the meaning of which is not
known.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such is the outline of these stories; the most definite and
agreed points are the most incomprehensible—namely, the
landing of the six men prior to that of the main wave, and the
concealed arrival of Oroi. The sons of Hotu-matua are not
known exactly. Kotuu is sometimes identified with Ko Tuumaheki,
and is sometimes a separate person. Miru occasionally
figures as one of them, which is inconsistent with the statement
that four of Tuukoihu’s descendants are the ancestors of four
subdivisions of that clan. Miru is also the name given in all
the lists to Tuumaheki’s son, the third ariki. Hotu Iti was
always a district, never the name of a clan. On the most interesting
point—namely, the origin of the Long Ears—there is
the most vagueness. According to Kilimuti, who was a recognised
authority, and whose account of the landing has been
followed, Hotu-matua and those in his boat were the Short Ears,
Hinelilu and the crew of the second boat the Long Ears. When
asked how it was that the two came together, he merely replied
that it was in the same way as we ourselves had various
nationalities on the yacht. According to this authority, the
destruction in the ditch took place in the time of Hotu-matua’s
children. Another version, given by three old men in conclave,
was that the Long Ears came into existence on the island through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>the “mana” of the third ariki. Discussion one day waxed
quite fierce on the point till Te Haha’s wife, who was a shrewd
middle-aged woman, turned and said, “Never mind them, Mama,
they don’t know anything about it,” which probably
summed up the situation. The story of the ditch and the
final extinction is well-established legend. The term Long Ears
seemed to convey to the natives not the custom of distending
the ears, but having them long by nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is interesting to compare the versions of these stories given
to the Expedition with those taken down from Salmon by
Paymaster Thomson of the <em>Mohican</em>. The statement made by
him, and repeated by various travellers, probably from the same
source, that Hotu-matua came from the east, was never met
with by us. Kilimuti did not know whence he came; the
direction in which Hotu-matua looked when dying would be
west, or more accurately, south-west. Juan put the home of
the first immigrants in the Paumotu; as a young man his
knowledge of legend was a step further from the original, but it
was often useful as summing up the general impression he had
received. According to the <em>Mohican</em> story the six early arrivals
included the brother of Hotu-matua and his wife; Oroi had been
the rejected suitor of this lady, and it was the competition for
her favour which had caused the quarrel with the family. The
same authority states that Hotu was in the boat which went
by the south and east and his wife Vakai in the other; Hinelilu
does not appear. Hotu is depicted as dividing the land between
his sons, but there is no mention of the ultimate triumph of the
descendants of Hotu-iti over those of Kotuu, which, as told to
us on more than one occasion, was the chief point in the story.
The finale, in which the old man looked towards his old home,
is omitted. The Long Ears suddenly appear on the island at a
much later time.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a> The story of the ditch is much the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kainga was a great man, and he lived near Tongariki. He
had three young sons; two of them lived with him, one of whom
was named Huriavai, and the other was called Rau-hiva-aringaerua
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>(literally, “Twin two faces”), for he had been born with
two faces, one of which looked before and the other behind.
Kainga’s third son was named Mahanga-raké-raké-a-Kainga;
he was not treated well at home, and had been adopted by a
woman who lived not far away, and there he had much fish to
eat. Now one day two men came to Kainga’s house and slept
there; they were Marama from Hanga Roa, and their names
were Makita and Roké-ava. Kainga killed two chickens, and
cooked the food and took it to his guests. Roké was asleep, and
Makita said, “What is this?” and Kainga replied, “Chicken,”
and Makita said, “I do not like it; I want man.” Kainga did
not like to refuse, and went outside and said to his two boys,
“Go and tell Mahanga to come here.” So the children went and
gave the message. When Mahanga heard it, he cried, but when
he had done weeping he went back with his brothers. Kainga
said to him, “Lie down and go to sleep,” and Kainga took a
club and hit the child on the head and killed him. Then he
cooked part of the body and gave it to Makita, saying, “Here is
food,” and went back to the cooking-place. Makita saw that it
was human flesh, and wakened Roké and told him, and Roké
was alarmed, and said, “I do not like it.” He broke the house
of Kainga, and hurried away. Makita also departed quickly.
Kainga was very angry, and said to the two men, “Why do you
throw away my food?” And he took the body of the child
and wrapped it in reeds and put it on the ahu.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kainga then said, “Bring me much wood to make a boat”;
and all men worked at the boat of Kainga, and he gave them
much food—chickens and potatoes and bananas, sugar-cane,
hens and fish and eels—but they did not make it well. Then
Kainga sent for Tuukoihu, the chief who lived at Ahu Tepeu,
on the western side, and said, “Come to me to make the boat”;
and Tuukoihu came, and he made a good boat twenty fathoms
long, and when it was finished it was launched, and thirty men
went in it to row. Now Makita and Roké and the people from
Hanga Roa and that part of the island had taken refuge on
Motu Nui and other islets of the coast off Rano Kao. Kainga
went in the boat to Motu Nui and rowed all round it, and Kainga
called to the people on the island, “Come out that I may see
you”; and they were all very frightened of Kainga because he
was a big man, so one after another all the men on the island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>came out that he might see them, and he said, “Are there no
more?” and they looked and saw that there were two more
hidden; so they brought them out, and they were Makita and
Roké, and Makita he slew, but Roké he let go.</p>

<hr class='c025'>

<p class='c007'>Now there was war between one side of the island and the
other side. The Koro-orongo, the Tupahotu, the Ureohei and
Ngaure fought the Haumoana, Miru, Marama, Hamea, and the
Raa. Kainga fought with his spear against one of the Miru
named Toari, and was angry because he could not kill him.
He went to his house and killed a white cock and gave it to the
child Huriavai to eat, and then he took five mataa and bound
them on wood. That evening Huriavai went to sleep; he
dreamed that the white cock was coming towards him, and that
he threw a stone at the bird and killed it, and he waked up
afraid. Kainga said, “What is it, child?” and the boy answered,
“It is the white cock; he is dead”; and Kainga was glad
of the dream, and said joyfully, “He is dead! To-morrow morning
early, at five o’clock, we will go and fight.” So on the morrow
he took the five mataa in his hand and Huriavai on his back.
The men of Hotu Iti fought the men of Anakena and Hanga Roa.
Kainga did not go into the battle, but he stood a little way off
with the child, and he saw that Toari no one could kill, and he
said to the child, “Go, boy, and take two spears.” Huriavai
was frightened, but he took two spears and went into the battle.
The men of Anakena came to kill the boy, but he did not run
away. They threw their spears, but they glanced off the child.
Then all Kainga’s men came forward, and they threw their spears
at Toari; but Huriavai threw one spear, and he killed him and he
lay dead. Kainga saw his enemy was slain, and took the boy
on his back and went away quickly. When Kainga was gone,
all the people of Hotu Iti fled, and the people of Anakena pursued,
and they killed all the people of Hotu Iti, thousands and thousands
and thousands, women and children and little children,
big children and young men, and old men who could not walk
away quickly. Some of those who escaped took refuge in the
cave known as Ana Te Ava-nui, and others fled to the island of
Marotiri (fig. 123). Kainga went to Marotiri, but Huriavai hid
in a hole on the mainland opposite; his brother, who had two
faces, was killed by a man named Pau-a-ure-vera. The face
behind said, “I see Pau-a-ure-vera; he comes to me with a spear
in his hand. You look too.” But the face in front said, “I do not
like to look; you look.” The face behind was angry, and said,
“You look too.” And while the two faces talked, Pau struck
the boy with his spear in the neck, and he fell dead, and Kainga
saw from the island the fall of his son.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>The day after the battle, when Hotu Iti had been vanquished,
Poié, who was one of the Haumoana and a big man, came to live
at Ana Havea, the cave near Tongariki (fig. 124), and took a
large boat with thirty men and went to the island of Marotiri. On
the island were many thousands of the people of Hotu Iti, but
among them there was one man, Vaha; his father was of Hotu
Iti, but his mother was of Anakena. He was the father of Toari,
who was killed by Huriavai, so he hated the men of Hotu Iti,
but no man dared kill him. When Poié came in his boat, he
said to Vaha, “Give me men to cook.” Vaha gave him one
thousand in the boat, and Poié went back to the shore and gave
each of the men of Anakena a man to eat; he took thousands
of children by the leg and dashed them against the stone. Every
day he did the same again, and brought a thousand men from
Marotiri. One day, when the boat came back, a man called
Oho-taka-tori, a Miru, was at Ana Havea and saw Poié throwing
the men on shore, and among them a man named Hanga-mai-ihi-te-kerau;
and Oho-taka-tori said to Poié, “Give me for
my fish that man with a fine name.” Poié said, “I give no fish
with a fine name to you who begin work at nine o’clock in the
morning.” Oho was angry with Poié; he was wearing a hat
with cocks’ feathers sticking out in front, and he turned it round
back side front, and went to the house of his daughter, who had
married a man of Hotu Iti called Moa, and lived near Tongariki.
He said to her, “Do not let your husband mourn for the men
of Hotu Iti”; the girl replied, “He does not tell me, but I think
he mourns much.” She gave her father food to eat, and he
went to his own home, the other side of the island. When Moa
came in from digging potatoes, his wife said, “Your father-in-law
has been here, and he said that you were not to cry for the men
of Hotu Iti”; and Moa replied, “I must mourn, but you are of
Hanga Roa,” and he did not eat any potatoes, but wept.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men who had not taken refuge on Marotiri were, as has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>been told, in Ana Te Ava-nui,<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c016'><sup>[71]</sup></a> and the men of Anakena had
made twenty holes in a row in the cliff above, and they stood
in the holes one behind the other, and lowered a net over the edge
of the cliff with two men in it with spears, and the men in the
holes held the rope and let down the net, and the men in the net
shouted to them “Pull up,” or “Give way,” till they were
opposite the cave, and then they killed the men in the cave with
their spears, and three brothers of Oho worked with these men.</p>

<p class='c007'>At five o’clock in the evening, when his wife did not know,
Moa took all sorts of food, and buried them so that no man
should see, and at seven o’clock he said to his wife, “Give me
the big net,” and she said, “Are you going to take fish?” and
he said, “Yes,” but he lied; he was going to Te Ava-nui.
He took the net and the food. By and by he left the net behind,
but he kept the food and went to Maunga Tea-tea.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c016'><sup>[72]</sup></a> There were
many of Poié’s men there, and all over Poike, but they were
asleep. He gathered there eight branches of palm, put them on
his back, and went to the cave, and all the men on the top of
the cliff were asleep, and Moa went down the cliff by the track
and entered the cave. The men inside did not sleep. They
said, “Who are you?” and he said, “Hush, I am Moa.” There
were only thirty men alive. For two and a half months they
had had nothing to eat in the cave, and only the strongest were
left. Moa gave the men the juice of the sugar-cane like water,
and little bits of potato, and then he asked, “Where are the bones
of the warrior Peri-roki-roki?” They replied, “He is down
there.” So Moa said, “Bring them to me”; and Moa made fish-hooks
of bone, and bound a hook to a palm branch; then he said
to the men, “I have made one for you; make seven,” and he
went back. When the net came down in the morning, the men
in the cave caught it with the hooks on the branches of palm,
and the men in the net called to those above to “drag up,” but
the men gave more line, and the men in the cave killed the men
in the net, and then they climbed up the rope and killed all the
men at the top except the brothers of Oho, those they did not kill.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Three days before this the men on Marotiri had rid themselves
of Vaha; it was in this way. The boy Huriavai, who was in
a hole on the mainland, was very hungry, for he was not
old enough to catch fish, and he ate seaweed. Vaha on the
island opposite took the stem of a banana and cut it into pieces,
so that it looked like yams, and put it where the boy could see
it, and Huriavai said, “My father has plenty of food.” So he
swam across, and Vaha killed him. Then Vaha took the corpse and
swam with it to the mainland. It was dark, but Kainga listened,
and heard the swish of the water, and he too went into the sea
and followed him, and when he got to shore he hid behind a big
stone, and when he saw Vaha coming, carrying on his back the
body of the child, he wept, and Kainga said, “Who are you?”
and he replied, “I am Vaha”; and Kainga said, “I am Kainga,
the slayer of Vaha.” And he slew him, and took the corpse of
Huriavai to the ahu, and then came and took the body of Vaha
as fish-man for food, brought it to Marotiri, and gave pieces to
all the people on the island. There were thirty men then left
there, but they had no fire, so they cooked the flesh in their
armpits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three days after this the men from Te Ava-nui came along,
and they shouted across from the mainland, “We have killed
the men in the net”; and Marotiri shouted back, “We too
have killed a man,” and they were all full of joy. The island
men swam ashore, and they killed all the men at Ana Havea.
The men from Marotiri went in one direction and the men from
Te Ava-nui in another, killing and slaying every one; but
Kainga went with neither, for he wished to find Poié. He went to
Ana Havea, but his enemy had fled, and he followed him all along
the south coast, till they were not far from Vaihu. Poié was a
very big man, but Kainga was a little one, and he had nothing
to eat. He called to Poié, “You have food, I have none; I shall
not kill you, I will go back; but another day I will kill you.”
The two parties of Hotu Iti men had now joined one another,
and Kainga went with them. Men and old men, old women and
children they killed all, but the fine women they took; the
sixty men divided the women between them. A man would
say to a woman, “Do you like me?” and if she said “No,” then
he killed her. Kainga told the men from Te Ava-nui to go to
one place, and the men from Marotiri to go to another, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>live with their wives and beget children, and so they did; but
Poié went to Hanga Roa.</p>

<hr class='c025'>

<p class='c007'>Kainga told a Tupahotu called Maikuku to give his daughter
to Poié, so she went to him and bore him many children, and
one day, when years had gone by, Kainga called together his men
and went over at night to the other side of the island to fight.
Maikuku was staying in the house of his daughter, and Kainga
had told him, “If Poié is not in the house, sleep with your head
outside the door”; and Kainga came and looked and saw that
the head of Maikuku was outside, and he said to him, “Then
Poié is not here?” and he said, “No, he has gone to the sea.”
The grand-daughter of Maikuku heard, and was angry for her
father, and she went a little way up the hill outside, and cried
aloud, “The enemy are coming to fight, and your father-in-law
is very bad, although he has had bananas and fish and much to
eat.” Poié heard the child speak, and he and his five brothers
hid their net and the fish, and they ran along the coast towards
Rano Kao, and Kainga went too, and then they swam to Motu
Nui. Kainga followed, and they went on to Motu Iti and then
swam to the land again, and came ashore at the foot of the cliff
below Orongo, and Poié’s brothers tried to run up the hill, but
Kainga’s men caught them and killed four. As Poié came up,
the blood of his brothers flowed down, and he wept; but Poié
they did not kill, because he had married the daughter of
Maikuku, and because they were all afraid. Now Kirireva,
a child of Hotu Iti, whose father had been killed by Poié,
stayed at Orongo, and the child asked if they were not
going to kill Poié, and the old men said, “No, we have
already killed four.” Kirireva shaved all his hair and his
eyebrows, and put on red paint and told Poié to stand up,
and he ran three times between his legs, and the third time Poié
fell, and the boy killed him with a club because he had slain his
father. Now, when Poié was dead, Kotuu was finished and
Hotu Iti victorious according to the words of Hotu-matua.</p>

<p class='c007'>The middle part of this story is briefly told by Thomson, but
his account differs in important points from the foregoing. Moa
is represented as the son of Oho-taka-toré, instead of his son-in-law,
and his action is designed to avenge his father; this is a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>comprehensible version. Kainga is dead. Huriavai is on
Marotiri, and on swimming ashore is killed by one of the enemy.
Vaha is Huriavai’s friend, who kills the slayer, and swims back to
Marotiri with the enemy’s body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our informant, Kapiera, was quite positive that the events
took place during the time of Ngaara’s grandfather, and refused
to be dislodged from his position because Juan pertinently
pointed out that this was inconsistent with the boat being made
by Tuukoihu, who landed with Hotu-matua.</p>

    <div>“<em>Do not be afraid of making generalisations because knowledge is as yet imperfect or incomplete, and they are therefore liable to alteration. It is only through such generalisations that progress can be made.</em>”—Dr. A. C. Haddon as President of the Folk Lore Society, 1919.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As we leave Easter Island, we pause to review our evidence and
find how far we have progressed towards the solution of its
problems.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may dismiss the vague suggestion that the archæological
remains in the island survive from the time when it was part of
a larger mass of land. Whatever may be the geological story of
the Pacific, no scientific authorities are prepared to prove that
such stupendous changes have taken place during the time which
it has been inhabited by man.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Instead of indulging in surmises as to the state of the world
in a remote past, it is safer to begin with existing conditions and
try to retrace the steps of development. It has already been seen
that various links connect the people now living on Easter Island
with the great images. Tradition is not altogether extinct; in a
few cases the names of the men are actually remembered who
made the individual statues, and also those of their clans which
are still in existence. But the two strongest bonds are the
wooden figures and the bird cult. The wooden figures were
being made in recent times, and they have a design on the back
resembling that on the stone images, while they also possess the
same long ears. There is no reason why a defunct type should
have been copied, and it is probable that they date at least as
far back as the same epoch. The bird cult also was alive in living
memory. It is allied to that of the statues by the residence of
the bird-man among the images, by the fact that the bird rite
for the child was connected with them, and above all by the
presence of a statue of typical form in the centre of the village
at Orongo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Assuming then, at any rate for the sake of argument, that the
stone figures were the work of the ancestors of the people of
to-day, the next step is to inquire who these people are. Here
for a certain distance we are on firm ground. They are undoubtedly
connected with those found elsewhere in the Pacific;
much of their culture is similar; and even the earliest voyagers
noted that their language resembled that found on the other
islands. The suggestion that Easter Island has been populated
from South America may therefore, for practical purposes, be
ruled out of the question. If there is any connection between
the two, it is more likely that the influence spread from the
islands to the continent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having reached this point, however, we are faced by the
larger problem. Who were the race or races who populated the
Pacific? Here our firm ground ends, for this is a very complicated
subject, with regard to which much work still remains to
be done. It is impossible as yet to make any broad statement,
which is not subject to qualification, or which can be implicitly
relied on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Solomon group and other islands off the coast of Australia
are inhabited by a people known as Melanesians, who have dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>skins, fuzzy hair, and thick lips, resembling to some extent the
natives of Africa; this area is called Melanesia. Certain outlying
islets are, however, populated by a different race, who possess
straight or wavy hair and fairer skins. Eastward of a line
which is drawn at Fiji this whiter race, called Polynesian, predominates,
and the eastern part of the Pacific is known as
Polynesia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Broadly speaking, the theory generally accepted has been that
negroid people are the earliest denizens, and that the lighter race
came down into Melanesia through the Malay peninsula, and
thence passed on through Melanesia in a succession of waves. A
large proportion of the invaders were probably of the male sex,
and took wives from amongst the original inhabitants. They
absorbed in many ways the culture of the older people, but did
not wholly abandon their own. It is suggested, for instance, that
while as a whole the conquerors adopted existing religions, the
secret societies, so often found in the Pacific, are connected with
their own rites and beliefs, which were guarded as something
sacred and apart.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will easily be seen that the task of tracing these migrations
is by no means simple. Canoes, carrying fighting men or immigrants,
bent on victory or colonisation, passed continually from
one island to another, and each island has probably its own
very complicated history. The Maoris of New Zealand, for
example, are a Polynesian race, but there are also traces there
of a darker people. Absolutely negroid elements are found
as far east as the Marquesas. Our servant Mahanga, whose
features are of that type, came from the Paumotu Islands
(fig. 89).</p>

<p class='c007'>The marvellous feats of seamanship performed in these wanderings,
often against the prevailing trade wind, would be
incredible if it were not obvious that they have been actually
accomplished. The loss of life was doubtless very great, and
many boats must have started forth and never been heard of
more. The fact remains, however, that native canoes have
worked their way over unknown seas as far north as the Hawaiian
or Sandwich Islands, and that somehow or other they reached
that little spot in the waste of waters now known as Easter
Island. The nearest land to Easter now inhabited, with the
exception of Pitcairn Island, is in the Gambier Islands, about
1,200 miles to the westward; the little coral patch of Ducie
Island, which lies between the two, is nearly 900 miles from
Easter, and has no dwellers. It has been suggested that the
original immigrants may have intended to make a voyage
from one known island to another and have been blown out of
their course. However this may be, a long voyage must have
been foreseen, or the boats would not have carried sufficient
provisions to reach so distant a goal. It is even more strange
to realise that, if the mixture of races found among the islanders
occurred after their arrival, more than one native expedition
has performed the miracle of reaching Easter Island.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>
<img src='images/i_293.jpg' alt='This page contains a map of the Pacific Ocean.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>The traditions of the present people do not, as has been seen,
give very material assistance as to the composition of the crew
nor how they reached the island. They tell us that their ancestors
were compelled to leave their original home through being
vanquished in war. This was a very usual reason for such
migrations, as the conquered were frequently compelled to choose
between voluntary exile or death; but to account for the discovery
of the island they are obliged to take refuge in the supernatural
and explain that its whereabouts were revealed in a
dream. The story of Hotu-matua gives no suggestion that the
Island was already inhabited, save for one very vague hint.
The six men who formed the first detachment of the party were
told that the island as revealed in the dream possessed not only
a great crater, but also “a long beautiful road.” The Long Ears,
who according to tradition were exterminated by the Short Ears,
may have been an earlier race, but it cannot be claimed that the
story tells us so. The two peoples are represented as coming
together, or as living side by side on the island. The whole
account is rendered more puzzling by the fact that, while the
Short Ears are said to have been the ancestors of the present
people, the fashion of making long the lobe of the ear prevailed
on the island till quite recently.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is noteworthy, however, that a legend exists elsewhere which
definitely reports that the later comers did find an earlier people
in possession. According to the account of Admiral T. de Lapelin,<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
there is a tradition at Mangareva in the Gambier Islands to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the effect that the adherents of a certain chief, being vanquished,
sought safety in flight; they departed with a west wind in two
big canoes, taking with them women, children, and all sorts of
provisions. The party were never seen again, save for one man
who subsequently returned to Mangareva. From him it was
learned that the fugitives had found an island in the middle of
the seas, and disembarked in a little bay surrounded by mountains;
where, finding traces of inhabitants, they had made
fortifications of stone on one of the heights. A few days later
they were attacked by a horde of natives armed with spears, but
succeeded in defeating them. The victors then pitilessly massacred
their opponents throughout the island, sparing only the
women and children. There are now no stone fortifications
visible at Anakena, but one of the hill-tops to the east of the
cove has, for some reason or other, been entrenched (fig. 96).</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning to more scientific evidence, we find that the Islanders
have always been judged to be of Polynesian race, as indeed
would naturally be expected from the easterly position of the
island in the Pacific Ocean. They have certainly traces of that
culture, and the great authority on the subject, Mr. Sydney Ray,
has pronounced the language to be Polynesian. The surprise,
therefore, which the results of the expedition have brought to
the anthropological world, is the discovery of the extent to which
the negroid element is found to prevail there both from the
physical and cultural points of view.</p>

<p class='c007'>Melanesian skulls are mainly of the long-headed type, while
Polynesian are frequently broad-headed. A collection of fifty-eight
skulls was brought back from Easter and examined by
Dr. Keith. He says in his report: “The Polynesian type is
fairly purely represented in some of the Easter Islanders,&#160;...
but they are absolutely and relatively a remarkably long-headed
people, and in this feature they approach the Melanesian more
than the Polynesian type.” A similar statement was quite
independently made to the Royal Geographical Society on this
head. In the discussion which followed the reading of a paper
on behalf of the Expedition, Capt. T. A. Joyce of the British
Museum, remarked that a few years ago he had examined the
skulls brought back from Easter Island by the late Lord Crawford.
“I then,” he continued, “wrote a paper which I never published.
It remained both literally and metaphorically a skeleton in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>cupboard, because I could not get away from the conclusion that
in their measurements and general appearance these skulls were
far more Melanesian than Polynesian.”<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a> In speaking of skulls,
Dr. Keith makes the interesting remark that the Islanders are
the largest-brained people yet discovered in the islands or shores
of the Pacific, and shows that their cranial capacity exceeds that
of the inhabitants of Whitechapel.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the culture of the island also, the Melanesian influence is
very strong. The custom of distending the lobe of the ear is
much more Melanesian than Polynesian. Dr. Haddon has
pointed out that an early illustration of an Easter Island canoe
depicts it with a double outrigger, after a type found in the
Nissan group in Melanesia.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c016'><sup>[76]</sup></a> An obsidian blade has been found
in the area of New Guinea influenced by Melanesian culture,
which has been described and figured by Dr. Seligman<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c016'><sup>[77]</sup></a>; he draws
attention to its striking likeness to the mataa of Easter Island.
Weapons of the same type, and wooden figures in which the ribs
are a prominent feature, have been found in the Chatham
Islands,<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c016'><sup>[78]</sup></a> but the respective amount of Polynesian and Melanesian
culture in these islands is as yet under discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most striking evidence is, however, found in connection
with the bird cult. It has been shown by Mr. Henry Balfour
that a cult with strong resemblance to that of Easter existed
in the Solomon Islands of Melanesia. It is there connected
with the Frigate-bird, a sea-bird which usually nests in trees
and is characterised by a hooked beak and gular pouch. In
treeless Easter Island the sacred bird is the Sooty Tern, which
is without the gular pouch and has a straight beak. In many
of the carvings on the island, however, the sacred bird is represented
with a hooked beak and a pouch (fig. 112). “This seems
to point to a recollection retained by the immigrants into Easter
Island of a former cult of the Frigate-bird which was practised
in a region where this bird was a familiar feature, and which was
gradually given up in the new environment when this bird,
though probably not unknown, was certainly not abundant”;<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c016'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
the cult being transferred to the locally numerous Tern.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Figures were also made in the Solomon Islands composed partly
of bird and partly of human form. Bird heads appear on human
bodies, as in Easter Island, and also human heads on bird bodies
(fig. 125). It is noteworthy that, even when the head which is
drawn on the bird body is human, it is depicted with bird-like
characteristics, the lower part of the face being given a beak-like
protrusion, till sometimes it is almost impossible to distinguish
whether the head is that of a man or a bird (no. 6). This
prognathous type, with the protrusion of the lower facial
region, appears to have become a convention, and it is found
in figures where the body as well as the head are human
(no. 7). This is the kind found in a modified form in the
Easter Island stone figures; they differ from any normal
human type in either Polynesia or Melanesia.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible as yet to give with any certainty a connected
account of the early history of Easter Island, but as a working
hypothesis the following may perhaps be assumed. There was
an original negroid element which brought with it the custom
of distending the ear, the wooden figures, and also the bird cult.
A whiter wave succeeded which mingled with the first inhabitants,
and the next generation adopted the fashion of the country in
stretching the lobe of the ear, and carried on the bird cult. At
some time in the course of settlement war arose between the
earlier and later comers, in which the former took refuge in
the eastern headland and were largely exterminated.</p>

<p class='c007'>If these suppositions are so far correct, the story of the landing
of Hotu-matua and the establishment of his headquarters at
Anakena refer to the Polynesian immigration, and it seems
reasonable to look to the Miru, who are settled in that part of the
island, and perhaps also to the allied clans of the Marama and
Haumoana, who together form the chief inhabitants of the district
of Kotuu, as the more direct descendants of the Polynesian
settlers. In confirmation of this we find that the ariki, or chief,
the only man who was necessarily of pure descent, is said to have
been “quite white.” The inscribed skulls, which are those of the
Miru, are reported to be of the Polynesian type. It is a somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>striking fact also that the ariki, in spite of his prominent
position in the island, took no part in the bird cult ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c007'>In endeavouring to arrive at even an approximate date for
these immigrations to the island, evidence outside its borders is
likely to prove our best guide. In the present state of our
knowledge we cannot even guess how long the negroid element
has been in the Pacific, but the lighter races are believed to have
entered it not earlier than the Christian era. The colonisation
of the Paumotus is placed at <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1000,<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c016'><sup>[80]</sup></a> and it has been suggested
by Volz that the Polynesian wave reached Easter Island about
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1400.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is at present no evidence to show whether the great
works were initiated by the earlier or the later arrivals. There
are other megalithic remains in the Pacific, notably great walls
of stone in the Caroline Islands. The Expedition found a stone
statue in Pitcairn,<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c016'><sup>[81]</sup></a> but we have as yet no complete information
with regard to these works or the circumstances of their construction.
The Polynesians are accredited with having carried
with them the fashion of erecting such monuments, but, if they
brought it to Easter Island, the form which it took was apparently
governed by conventions already existing in the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, it seems possible that the makers of the
images may have come from a country where they were accustomed
to model statues in wood, and finding no such material
in the island, substituted for it the stone of Raraku. Sir Basil
Thomson has pointed out that there were in the Marquesas
wooden statues standing on erections of stone and also wooden
dolls. Further knowledge of what exists elsewhere will probably
throw light on the matter, but it is, in any case, owing to
the fact that there is to be found at Easter a volcanic ash
which can be easily wrought that we have the hundreds of
images in the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the duration of the image era, it has been
shown that the number of statues, impressive as it is, does not
necessarily imply that their manufacture covered a vast space
of time. It must, however, in all probability have extended over
several centuries. As to its termination, the worship is reported
as having been in existence in 1722; at any rate the ahu and
statues were then in good repair. By 1774 some of the statues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>had fallen, and by about 1840 none remained in place. It seems,
therefore, on the whole, most likely that the cult, and probably
also the manufacture of the images, existed till the beginning
of the eighteenth century. The alternative explanation can only
be that though the cult had long been dead the statues remained
in place, not materially injured either by man or weather, until
Europeans first visited the island, and that then an era of devastation
set in which in a hundred years demolished them all.
This, though not actually impossible, does not seem equally
probable.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know that a large number, probably the majority, of the
statues came to their end through being deliberately thrown
down by invading enemies. The legendary struggles between
Kotuu and Hotu Iti, in which Kainga played so prominent a
part, are always spoken of as comparatively recent history, and
one old man definitely asserted that they took place in the time
of the grandfather of the last ariki, which may be as far back as
the eighteenth century. If these wars occurred between the visit
of the Dutchmen in 1722 and that of the Spaniards in 1770, it is
at least possible that it was during their course that the manufacture
of the images ended and their overthrow began. It will
be remembered that, while Roggeveen speaks of the island as
cultivated and fertile, the navigators fifty years later are greatly
disappointed with the barren condition in which they find it.
In the curious absence, however, of any reference in these legends
to the conditions of the images, this must remain, for the present
at any rate, as surmise only.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be interesting to know more clearly the part played
by the advent of the white men in the evolution of the culture
of the island. While it cannot be definitely stated that it was
their arrival which, by detracting from the reverence paid to the
statues, hastened their downfall, we know that it largely affected
native conceptions. Not only was it the probable cause of the
abandonment at the end of the eighteenth century of the practice
of distending the lobe of the ear,<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c016'><sup>[82]</sup></a> but it inspired a new form of
worship. It is interesting to see in the drawings of foreign ships,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>which appear side by side with older designs, a new cult actually
in course of intermingling with the old forms. Did we not
possess the key to them, these pictures would add one more to
the mysteries of the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such evidence as can be obtained from the condition of the
images points to the fact that it cannot be indefinite ages since
they were completed. For example, in certain statues, those
which are generally considered the most recent, the surface
polish still remains in its place in the cavity representing the eye,
and on parts of the neck and breast where it has been somewhat
sheltered by the chin, notwithstanding the fact that the soft
stone is one that easily weathers (<em>Frontispiece</em>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The question as to what the statues represent is not yet fully
solved. It seems probable that the form was a conventional
one and was used to denote various things. Some of the statues
may have been gods; the name of a single image on an inland
ahu, one of the very few which were remembered, was reported
to be “Moai Te Atua.” It is, however, probably safe to regard
ahu statues as being in general representations of ancestors,
either nearer or more distant, this does not necessarily exclude
the idea of divinity. The hat may have been a badge of
rank; warriors in Tahiti wore a certain type of hat as
a special mark of distinction.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a> Reasons have been given for
suggesting that the images on Raraku may have been memorials
of bird-men; and we know that some of the statues, as those on
the southern slope of Raraku and in Motu Nui, denoted boundaries.
Lastly, it is not impossible that some of the figures,
such as those approaching the ahu of Paukura, were simply
ornamental, “to make it look nice.” The nearest approach
which we ourselves have to such divers employment of the same
design is in our use of the Latin cross. Fundamentally a sacred
sign, it is used not only to adorn churches and for personal
ornament, but also to mark graves and denote common and
central grounds, such as the site of markets and other public
places. It is also used to preserve the memory of certain spots,
as for instance, Charing Cross, where the body of Queen Eleanor
rested.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last problem to be considered is that dealing with the
tablets. An account has been given elsewhere of what is known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of their general meaning. The figures themselves may be classed
as ideograms—that is, signs representing ideas—but it is doubtful,
as has been shown, if a given sign always represented the same
idea. Each sign was in any case a peg on which to hang a large
amount of matter which was committed to memory, and is
therefore, alas! gone for ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>No light has yet been thrown on the origin of the script. No
other writing has been found in the Pacific, if we except a form
from the Caroline Islands, and a few rock carvings in the
Chatham Islands, whose connection with the glyphs of Easter
Island is as yet very doubtful.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be satisfactory, in view of the relation of the Miru
ariki to the tablets, and the tradition that they came with Hotu-matua,
if internal evidence could show that it was of Polynesian
origin. Unfortunately for this theory, the Melanesian bird
figures largely among the signs. It is, of course, conceivable
that they may have undergone local adaptation. While it is not
probable that we shall ever be able to read the tablets, it is not
impossible that further discovery may throw light on the history
of the signs, and show to what extent the script has been imported
from elsewhere, or how far it is, with much of its other culture,
a product of the isolation of Easter Island.</p>

</div>

<p class='c019'>Lieutenant Bligh went to the Pacific in 1788, in command of
H.M.S. <em>Bounty</em>, with orders to obtain plants of the bread-fruit, and
introduce it into the English possessions in the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c008'>He spent six months at Tahiti, collecting the fruit, and there the
crew fell victims to the charms of its lotus-eating life, its sunshine,
its flowers, and its women. Soon after the ship sailed the majority
of the men mutinied, being led by Christian, the Master’s mate.
They set Bligh and eighteen others adrift in an open boat, and
returned in the ship to Tahiti. Subsequently, fearing that retribution
might follow, Christian and eight fellow mutineers left Tahiti
on the <em>Bounty</em>, taking with them nine native women, and also some
native men to act as servants. For years their fate remained a
mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>The refuge found by the party was the lonely island of Pitcairn.
They took out of the ship everything that they required, and then
sank the vessel, fearing that her presence might betray them. The
new habitation proved anything but an amicable Eden. The native
servants were ill-treated by their masters, and in 1793 rose against
them, murdering Christian and four other white men; but were
finally themselves all killed by the Europeans. The women also
were discontented with their lot, and in the following year they made
a raft in order to quit the island, an attempt which was of course
foredoomed to failure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the four mutineers left, one, McCoy, committed suicide through
an intoxicating drink made from the ti plant. Another, Quintal,
having threatened the lives of his two comrades, Adams and Young,
was killed by them with an axe, in self-defence. A woman who
witnessed the scene as a child, survived till 1883, and we were told
by her grandchildren that her clearest recollection was the blood-spattered
walls and the screaming women and children. Young,
who had been a midshipman on the <em>Bounty</em>, died shortly after, and
in 1800 John Adams (<em>alias</em> Alexander Smith) was left the sole man
on the island, with the native women and twenty-five children.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later ensued not the least strange part of the story. Adams was
converted by a dream, and awoke to his responsibility towards the
younger generation. He taught them to read from a Bible and
Prayer-book saved from the <em>Bounty</em>, and the offspring of the mutineers
became a civilised and God-fearing community.</p>

<p class='c008'>The small colony were first found by an American ship, the <em>Topaz</em>,
in 1808, but little seems to have been heard of the discovery, and
six years later H.M. ships <em>Briton</em> and <em>Tagus</em>, sailing near the island,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>were much astonished at being hailed by a boat-load of men who
spoke English.</p>

<p class='c008'>By 1856 the population of Pitcairn numbered about one hundred
and ninety, and they were removed, by their own request, to the
larger Norfolk Island. Six homesick families, however, against
the strong advice of Bishop Selwyn, subsequently returned to
Pitcairn.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon of Wednesday, August 18th, 1915, the last
vestige of the long coast of Easter Island dipped below the
horizon. We realised that we were homeward bound. Owing
to the war, and our prolonged residence on the island, it was
no longer possible to keep to the plan made before leaving
England and follow up Easter trails elsewhere in the Pacific.
We decided, however, to adhere to the original arrangement
of going first to Tahiti, and then to make the return voyage by
the Panama Canal, which was now open. One of our principal
objects in visiting Tahiti was to collect all the letters, newspapers,
and money which had been forwarded to us there during the
last twelve months. With the exception of one stray letter,
written the previous November, we had had no mail since <em>Mana’s</em>
first return to the island a year before. It seemed desirable to
visit Pitcairn Island on the way thither; it was but little out of
our route, and was said to have prehistoric remains.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had a very good voyage for the 1,100 miles from Easter
to Pitcairn, staggering along with a following wind. The wind
was indeed so strong that we became anxious for the safety of
the dinghy in her davits, and swung her inboard for, I believe,
the only time on the voyage. We arrived at Pitcairn on August
27th. The island, as seen from the sea, rises as a solitary mass
from the water. It is apparently the remaining half of an old
crater, and is some two miles in width. An amphitheatre of
luxuriant verdure faces northwards; its lowest portion, or
arena, is perhaps 400 feet above sea-level, and rests on the top
of a wall of grey rock. The other three sides of the amphitheatre
are encircled by high precipitous cliffs. The green gem,
in its rocky setting, was a refreshing change after treeless Easter
Island.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span><em>Mana</em> was welcomed by a boat-load of sturdy men, who were
definitely European in appearance and manner; they were
mostly of a sallow white complexion, though a few had a darker
tinge. They spoke English, though with an intonation different
from that of the Dominions, America, or the Homeland. A
local patois is sometimes used on the island which is a mixture
of English and Tahitian, but pure Tahitian is not understood.
A graceful invitation was given by the Chief Magistrate, Mr.
Gerard Christian, to come and stay on shore, and was accepted
for the following day, which, the Islanders said, “will be the
Sabbath.” This was a somewhat surprising statement, as the
day was Friday, and caused a momentary wonder whether
something had gone wrong with the log of <em>Mana</em>. “We will
explain all that later,” added our hosts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning therefore the big ten-oared boat turned up
again, Mr. Christian bringing us the following kind letter from
the missionaries, who we now learned were on the island. It
was addressed “To the Gentlemen concerned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We suggested bringing food, but that was declined as unnecessary.
The trip to the shore, even in so big a boat, is somewhat
adventurous. The landing-place is in Bounty Bay, below
the precipitous cliffs off the north-east corner of the island,
beneath whose waters were sunk the remains of His Majesty’s
ship. The shore is reached, even under propitious circumstances,
through a white fringe of drenching surf; happily the Islanders
are excellent oarsmen, for the boat is apt to assume the vertical
position usually associated with pictures of Grace Darling. A
lifeboat sent as a gift from England in 1880 has proved too short
for the character of the waves. The village is gained by a steep
path, cut at times in the rock, and at the summit we found
standing under the trees a group in white Sunday attire waiting
to welcome us.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>We were now beginning to understand the meaning of the
difference in days. Service used to be held at Pitcairn after the
manner of the Church of England, but in 1886 the island was
visited by one of the American sect calling themselves “Seventh
Day Adventists.” The Society is Christian, but the members
regard as binding many of the Old Testament rules. Saturday
is observed as the divinely appointed day of rest, pork is considered
unclean, and a tenth part of goods is set aside for religious
purposes. Special attention is paid to Biblical prophecy, and
the end of the world is thought to be near. It was not difficult
to convert the reverent little community on Pitcairn to views
for which it was claimed that they were the plain teaching of
the Bible, and various persons were shortly baptised in the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The group who awaited us were headed by our most kind
hosts, the missionary and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Adams, who
were of Australian birth.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a> Sunday school was just over and
service about to begin. It was held in an airy building filled
with a large congregation. The sermon was on prophecy as
found in the books of Daniel and Revelation, and fulfilled in the
division of the Empire of Alexander the Great. It was depressing
to be told that the late war is only the beginning of trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>We went back with Mr. and Mrs. Adams to luncheon, which
was served at 2.30, and composed principally of oranges and
bananas. It was a very dainty if, to some of us who had breakfasted
at 7 o’clock, a rather unsubstantial repast. Our hosts
were vegetarians and had only two meals a day, but subsequently
kind allowance was made for our less moderate appetites. I was
glad of a rest in the afternoon, but S., who attended a second
service, said it had been the most interesting part of the Sunday
observances; it was a less formal gathering, when personal
religious testimonies were given by both young and old. Later
we were shown a little settlement of huts in the higher part of
the island, where once a year the community retire for ten days
and have a series of camp meetings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teachings of the new religion are practically observed.
The tithe barn, at the time of our visit, held £100 worth of
dedicated produce which was awaiting shipment. It was the
prettiest sight to see the fruits of the earth, being brought into
it, in the form of loads of various tropical produce. The whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>community abstains from alcohol and, nominally at any rate,
from tobacco, though one old gentleman was not above making
an arrangement for a private supply from the yacht. Tea and
coffee are thought to be undesirable stimulants, and even the
export of coffee was beginning to be discouraged. The place
suffers admittedly from the social laxity characteristic of Polynesia;
but the evil is being combated by its spiritual leaders,
and is cognisable by law. The whole atmosphere is extraordinary;
the visitor feels as if suddenly transported, amid the
surroundings of a Pacific Island, to Puritan England, or bygone
Scotland. It is a Puritanism which is nevertheless light-hearted
and sunny, without hypocrisy or intolerance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general influence of the missionaries seemed very helpful
to the little community, and they also conducted a school for
its younger members. Most of the inhabitants can read, but the
subject matter of books is too far away for them to be of much
interest, and the only application, it was noticed, which was
made to the yacht for literature, was for picture papers of the
war. We gave by request an hour’s talk on the travels of the
<em>Mana</em>, and it was listened to with apparent understanding, or
at any rate with politeness; the chief interest shown was in the
manner of life of the Easter Islanders, about which many questions
were asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The houses are substantially built of wood with good furniture.
A well-made chest of drawers was a birthday present to the
missionary’s wife from the young men of the island. There is
a separate bedroom or cubicle for nearly every inhabitant, and
some houses have a room set apart for meals. Hospitality was
shown without stint, and we were entertained during our stay
to a series of attractive repasts in various homes; our hosts bore
such names as Christian, Young, and McCoy. Meat is limited
to goat or chicken, but there is a profusion of tropical produce,
and oranges are too numerous to gather. The coconut trees
are unfortunately dying. Each household has a share of the
ground rising behind the village, and the hillside is traversed by
shady avenues of palms and bananas, which afford at every turn
glimpses of outstanding cliffs and the brilliant blue of the ocean.
The standard of life compares very favourably with that of an
English village, and is immeasurably superior to that achieved
on Easter Island under similar circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Pitcairn has the dignity of being a democratic self-governing
community, with a Magistrate and two houses of legislature.
The present Constitution was suggested by the Captain of H.M.S.
<em>Champion</em> in 1892, and superseded an earlier one. The Lower
House, known as “the Committee,” comprises a Chairman and
two members, also an official Secretary; it makes regulations
which are submitted to the Upper House or “Council.” The
Council consists of the Chief Magistrate, with two assessors and
the Secretary, and it acts also as a court of justice. The two
committee members and a constable are nominated by the
magistrate, but the other officials are elected annually by all
inhabitants over eighteen years; Pitcairn was therefore the first
portion of the British Empire to possess female suffrage.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was interesting to see the Government Records, though the
present book does not go back beyond above fifty years, earlier
ones having apparently disappeared. This contained the Laws
of 1884 revised in 1904; regulations for school attendance; a
category of the chief magistrates; a chronicle of visits from
men-of-war and mention of Queen Victoria’s presents, consisting
of an organ in 1879 and newly minted Jubilee coins received in
1889. There were also recorded the births, marriages, and
deaths of the island since 1864; and a description of the various
brands adopted by respective owners for their goats, chickens,
and trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the legislative enactments was more than one concerned
with the preservation of cats, the object being to keep down
rats. Thus the laws of 1884 direct that:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any person or persons after this date, September 24th, 1884,
maliciously wounding or causing the death of a cat, without
permission, will be liable to such punishment as the Court will
inflict.... Should any dog, going out with his master, fall in with
a cat, and chase him, and no effort be made to save the cat, the
dog must be killed; for the first offence—fine 10s. Cats in any
part of the island doing anyone damage must be killed in the
presence of a member of Parliament.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Illicit medical practice is forbidden, and the regulation on this
head runs as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may be lawful for parents to treat their own children in
case of sickness. But no one will understand that he is at liberty
to treat, or give any dose of medicine, unless it be one of his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>family, without first getting licence from the President. Drugs
may not be landed without permission.”</p>

<p class='c007'>More recent laws enact, that each family may keep only six
breeding nannies; and that coconuts may only be gathered under
supervision of the Committee or in company with their owners
of the same patch, in case of want, however, they may be plucked
for drinking. Persons killing fowls must present the legs (<em>i.e.</em>
the lower portion which bears the brand) to a member of the
Government.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the entries of deaths are recorded their known, or presumed,
cause; those occasioned by accident are somewhat
numerous, and include fatal results from climbing cliffs after
birds, chasing goats, and falling from trees. Wills can be made
by simply writing them in the official book, but entries under
this head were not numerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The island is in the jurisdiction of the British Consul at Tahiti,
but the Magistrate explained sadly that it was then two years
since it had been possible for his superior to send any
instructions. In very serious matters, such as murder or divorce,
reference is necessary to the High Commissioner at Fiji, and
five years may elapse before an answer is received.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is indeed comparatively simple to communicate from
Pitcairn with the outside world, particularly now that it lies
near the route from Panama to New Zealand. Warning of
the approach of a vessel is given by the church bell, and all
hands rush forthwith to launch the boat and pull out to the ship.
It is reported that once the bell sounded whilst a marriage was
being celebrated, the crowded church emptied at once, and the
bride, bridegroom, and officiator were left alone. Sooner or
later a letter can thus be handed on board, but to obtain a
reply is another matter; no steamer will undertake to deliver
passengers, goods, or mails to the island. It does not pay to
spend time over so small a matter, the liner may pass in the night,
or the weather at the time may render communication with the
shore impossible. During our visit notice was given that a ship
was approaching; the men, who were at the time engaged in
digging for the Expedition, threw down their tools and the boat
started for the vessel, only to founder among the breakers of
Bounty Bay. The place is too remote to be visited by the
trading vessels which visit the Gambier Islands, and as there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>no anchorage, it is by no means easy for the Islanders to keep
any form of ship on their own account. In normal times a British
warship calls every alternate year, but its visits were suspended
during the war. Of the two islands, Easter, which has at least
definite bonds with a firm on the mainland, is on the whole the
easier of access.</p>

<p class='c007'>The economic problem of Pitcairn lies in the difficulty of
making it self-supporting. Food and housing materials abound,
but clothes, tools, and similar articles must be obtained from
elsewhere; while to secure in return a market for its small
exports is almost impossible. It is sometimes said that as the
result, the inhabitants have grown so accustomed to be objects
of interest and charity, that they have become pauperised and
expect everything to be given them freely by passing ships.
This was certainly not our experience. They made us a large
number of generous gifts, such as bundles of dried bananas and
specimens of their handiwork—hats, baskets, and dried leaves,
cleverly embroidered and painted. On the other hand they took
with gratitude any articles which were given by us, either as
presents or in return for the things we purchased. One request
has been received since we left the island; it was made with
many apologies by the Chief Magistrate, and was for a Bible of
the Oxford Teachers’ Edition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The position, however, is unsatisfactory, and it seems very
desirable that if possible more frequent communication should
be established. In any case it is to be hoped that now peace
reigns, a warship may visit the place at least once a year.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is frequently suggested that the Pitcairners must have
deteriorated in physique by intermarriage; as far, however, as
we were able to observe, such is not the case. It has been remarked,
indeed, that a large number have lost their front teeth, but
in this they are not unique. Dr. Keith observes, in the report
previously alluded to, that many Pacific Islanders are extremely
liable to disease and loss of teeth. The effect of such disease is, he
states, to be seen in every one of the skulls from Easter regarded as
belonging to a person of over twenty-five years; “tooth trouble
is even more prevalent in Easter Island than in the slums of
our great towns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We were asked to collect pedigrees on Pitcairn and make
observations from the point of view of the Mendelian theory;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>this would, however, have been a very long and troublesome
business, and we did not feel assured that the results would be
sufficiently exact to justify it. While there has possibly been
no fresh infusion of South Sea blood, the islanders have constantly
been in contact with white men. Between 1808 and 1856, three
hundred and fifty vessels touched at Pitcairn, and on various
occasions shipwrecked mariners and others have taken up their
abode on the island, and intermixed with the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Pitcairn Islanders have been described as the “Beggars
of the Pacific,” and, on the contrary, have also been depicted as
saints in a modern Eden. Needless to say they are neither the
one nor the other, but inheritors of some of the weaknesses and
a surprising amount of the strength of their mixed ancestry.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the point of view of its main and scientific object, our
visit had satisfactory results. The island was uninhabited when
the mutineers arrived, but there were traces of past residents.
The sites of three “marae,” or native structures, among the undergrowth
were pointed out. They are said to have been preserved
by the first Englishmen, but were unfortunately destroyed
comparatively recently and very little of them is still preserved.
The old people could remember when bones could be seen lying
about in their vicinity. The islanders most kindly offered to
dig out what still existed of these remains, and two days running
the whole population turned out for excavation. The most
interesting of the erections proved to be one situated on the
cliff looking down on to Bounty Bay; we were only able roughly
to examine it on the morning of our departure. It appeared to
have been made of earth, not built of stone, and by clearing away
some of the scrub we were able to arrive at the conclusion that
it had been an embankment some 12 feet high, built on the
immediate edge of the vertical cliff, and had had two faces.
The face that was directed seawards was almost vertical, whilst
the one towards the land formed an inclined plane, that measured
37 feet between its highest and its lowest points. It seemed
clear that both sides had been paved with marine boulders.
In general character it resembled to some extent one of the
semi-pyramid ahu of Easter, but dense vegetation and tree
growth rendered it impossible to speak definitely, and the
form may have been determined by the shape of the cliff.
It was remembered that three statues had stood on it, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>one in particular had been thrown down on to the beach beneath.
The headless trunk of this image is preserved; it is 31 inches
in height, and the form has a certain resemblance to that of
Easter Island, but the workmanship is much cruder. There is
said to have been also a statue on a marae on the other side of the
island.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are interesting rock carvings in two places, both of
which are somewhat difficult to reach. S. managed however
to photograph one set, and a dear old man undertook the scramble
to the other site, which was practically inaccessible to booted
feet, and made drawings of them for the Expedition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then we had a great whip-up for any stone implements which
might have been found; Miss Beatrice Young most kindly
assisted and induced the owners to bring out their possessions.
Over eighty were produced. The Islanders were much pleased
to think that their contribution would be numbered among the
treasures of the British Museum, but the argument that “a
hundred years hence they would still be there” left them cold;
for, as they explained, “the end of the world would have come
before then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We spent in all four nights on the island, which forms, we
believe, a record sojourn for visitors; it is a very happy memory.
A large portion of the population asked for passages to Tahiti,
but the hearts of most failed before the end, and we on our part
drew the line at taking more than two men, who would work
their passage. Those who finally came with us were brothers,
Charles and Edwin Young, descendants of Midshipman Young.
They arrived on board with their hats wreathed with flowers—true
Polynesian fashion—accompanied by many friends and
relatives. Charles had been on one of the island trading vessels,
but Edwin had never before left his home (fig. 132).</p>

<p class='c007'>From Pitcairn we made for Rapa, known as Rapa-iti or Little
Rapa, to distinguish it from Rapa-nui or Great Rapa; which,
as has been seen, is one of the names for Easter. It is a French
possession and only visited by a vessel occasionally. It is seven
hundred miles from Pitcairn, and was somewhat out of our route
for Tahiti, but the Sailing Directions reported a number of prehistoric
buildings, which they termed “forts.” We were anxious
to inspect them and see what relation, if any, they bore to buildings
on Easter Island; but disappointment, alas! awaited us.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>The side of the island on which is the settlement was at the time
of our visit the windward aspect; there was a strong breeze
and quite a heavy sea. We remained abreast the village for some
hours awaiting the pilot, who is said to come off to visiting vessels,
but no one appeared, nor was any signal made on the shore.
Either they were afraid of us, or did not like the look of the
weather. It was not one of the islands we had originally intended
visiting, and we had no chart.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had to sail the ship the whole time in order to keep our
station, and eventually our forestay gave out; this meant putting
her instantly before the wind, or we should have been dismasted.
We therefore ran under the lee of the land and made good our
damage. It would have taken a long time to thrash back to our
original station, so we reluctantly gave up the attempt to make
a landing. The coast is extremely fine, bold, and precipitous,
but that, and the illustration given, is all that we can tell of
Rapa.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>TAHITI</h4>

<p class='c018'>Wallis is the first European known certainly to have seen Tahiti.
He visited it in 1767, and was followed two years later by Cook.
The predominant chiefs on the island at this time were Amo and
his wife Purea, of the district of Paparo on the south coast. They
are chiefly notorious as the founders of the great marae—or
“temple”—of Mahaiatea, which they built in honour of their
infant son, Teriiere. This work must have been in progress when
Wallis anchored on the other side of the island. The demands which
they made on their fellow natives in order to secure its erection
were so extortionate that a rising took place against them; and by
the time Cook made his first appearance they were shorn of much
of their glory. Subsequently various other navigators visited the
island. Cook anchored there a second time, and H.M.S. Bounty
made a prolonged sojourn. In 1797 thirty missionaries arrived,
sent from England by the London Missionary Society.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time another native family was in the ascendant, whose
territory was on the north coast. They have become known as
the Pomare, a name crystallised by the missionaries, but which was
in reality only one of the minor appellations which had been adopted,
native fashion, by the chief of the day. Pomare II. was baptised
in 1819.</p>

<p class='c008'>About forty years later Roman Catholic missionaries arrived, and
a struggle for ascendancy took place between them and the London
Society. The Home Government refused to support the Protestants.
Queen Pomare IV., therefore, though she much preferred
the English, was compelled to apply for a French protectorate,
which was established in 1843. On the death of the old Queen in
1877, the French recognised her son, Pomare V., who had married
his cousin Marau. The new Queen was the daughter of a chiefess
known as Arii Taimai, who had married an English Jew named
Salmon.<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c016'><sup>[85]</sup></a> Miss Gordon Cumming, who visited the island at the time,
gives an interesting account of the procession round the island to
proclaim the new sovereigns, in which she herself took part. In
1880 Pomare handed over his claims to the French Government, by
whom the island was then formally annexed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>We sighted Tahiti on the 16th of September, 1915, sailed along
its coast with interest, and anchored in the afternoon at Papeete
on the north shore. It was wonderful to return once more to
the great world, even in its modified form at Tahiti, and the
Rip van Winkle sensation was most curious. The Consul, Mr.
H. A. Richards, was early on board with a kind welcome, and
sent us round the longed-for sacks containing a year’s accumulation
of letters and newspapers. The mail, however, brought
bad personal news, and though life had to go on as usual, recollections
of the island have suffered from every point of view.<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Tahiti, as seen from the sea, with its mass of broken mountains
covered with verdure, is undoubtedly very beautiful; and
the sunset effects over the neighbouring island of Moorea are
particularly striking. The lagoon too is fascinating, and refreshing
expeditions were made in the motor launch to study
the wonders of its protecting coral reef. When on land, however,
the charm of the island is somewhat dissipated. The inhabited
strip round the coast, which varies from nothing up to some two
miles in width, is covered with bungalows and little native
properties, and is so full of coconuts and palms that all effect
of the mountains is lost. Though it was only the month of
September at the time of our visit it was very hot and airless,
making all mental and physical exertion an effort. I went one
morning for a walk at 6.30 in the hope of better things, but even
then it felt as if Nature had forgotten to open her windows. The
wild charm of romance which greeted the early voyagers and
which must have assuaged the struggle of the first missionaries
is now no more. Papeete is civilised: it is a port for the mail
steamers between America and New Zealand. It is under French
rule, but a large proportion of business is in the hands of the
British and also of the Chinese.</p>

<p class='c007'>We lived at the hotel, as <em>Mana</em> had to go on the slip, and had
an interesting fellow-guest in an American geologist. He was
travelling in the Pacific with the object of proving that it had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>never been a continent, but that the islands were sporadic
volcanic upheavals from the ocean bed. He had found himself
involved in the everlasting quarrel between geologists and
biologists, who each want the world constructed to prove their
own theories. In this case a biologist wished for continuity
of land to account for the presence of the same snail in islands
far removed. Our friend had contended that the molluscs
might have travelled on drift-wood, but was told in reply that
salt water did not “suit their constitution.” He had then
argued that they could easily have gone with the food in native
canoes. “Anyhow,” he concluded, with a delightful Yankee
drawl, “to have the floor of the ocean raised up fifteen thousand
feet, for his snails to crawl over, is just too much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>S. was presented by the Consul to the French Governor, and
I called, according to instructions, to pay my respects to his
wife, who proved to be both young and charming. She was
good enough subsequently to send an invitation to a tea-party,
which differed interestingly from similar functions at home.
It took place in a large room where twenty chairs, covered with
brocade, were arranged in a circle which was broken only by a
settee. On this sat the hostess, and by her side, either as the
greatest stranger, or as having taken the precaution to be an
early arrival, the Stewardess of the <em>Mana</em>. One by one the
chairs filled up, and each fresh arrival, after greeting her
entertainer, went round and shook hands with every one
already there. The hostess retained her seat, from which she conversed
across to various points of the circle. No one moved
except that when a delightful tea came in, it was handed
round by the young girls; no servant appeared—they are almost
impossible to get. The Governor earned our particular gratitude
by his kindness in sending daily a copy of the war bulletin,
which arrived by wireless from Honolulu and New Zealand;
though the installation was not at the time sufficiently advanced
to be capable of sending out messages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Germans were interned in the bay on what was known as
Quarantine Island, and were employed to do a certain amount
of leisurely work on the roads, at a comparatively high rate of
pay; at the same time the French subjects, native and half-caste,
had been called up for much harder military service and
received the standard remuneration, which was much lower.
It was commonly reported that the latter had sent in a petition
humbly begging that they might be considered as German
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>During our time on the island the anniversary occurred of
the visit of Von Spee’s fleet on their way to Easter Island, and the
trees were adorned with official notices proclaiming a public
holiday in memory of the French victory. What happened
on that occasion is not precisely clear, and each person gives
a different account. It seems, however, that as the cruisers
<em>Scharnhorst</em> and <em>Gneisenau</em> appeared without any proper announcement,
the shore batteries fired across their bows to stop
them. The Germans replied, and some houses in the town were
set on fire. The French gun-boat <em>Zelée</em> was sunk in the harbour,
also a German ship which had been taken as a prize. The
custodian of the coal supply set it on fire to prevent it from
falling into the enemy’s hands; this action was subsequently
justified, as it transpired that the Germans had given out that
they were going to Papeete in order to obtain coal. After a
certain number of shots had passed in both directions, the enemy
went on their way.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had particular pleasure in making the acquaintance of
the late Queen, widow of Pomare V., an able and cultured lady,
who lives in a villa in Papeete, and calls herself simply “Madame
Marau Taaroa.” She was kind enough to lend us a valuable
book written by her mother, Arii Taimai, which tells the history
of the island as related by family traditions and combines with
this account the information given by the early voyagers. Her
charming daughter, Princess Takau Pomare, who had been
educated in Paris, placed us under a great obligation by constituting
herself our cicerone. She took us to see the monument
on Venus Point, erected to mark the spot where Cook observed
the transit of Venus; and also the Pomare mausoleum. Miss
Gordon Cumming records that it was the ancient habit at Tahiti
for the dead to be placed in a house, watched till only dust and
ashes remained, and then buried securely in the mountain to
guard against possible desecration; this custom, she states,
still survived in her day in the case of departed royalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had also a delightful motor drive with the Princess to
some family property on the south side of the island, lunching
at a small hotel which was nothing if not up-to-date, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>dignified with the name of the Tipperary Hotel. The proprietor,
a Frenchman, advertised it by stating that while it was a “long,
long way to Tipperary,” it was only a short way to his establishment.
He had adorned the walls of the dining-room with
large frescoes of the flags of the Allies, leaving, as he explained,
“plenty of room for Holland, Greece, and America.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The marae of Tahiti have vanished, but on the way back we
stopped to see all that remains of a once famous pile. Nothing
now exists but a mass of overgrown coral stones, converted into
a lime kiln. Fortunately Cook and his companion Banks both
visited Mahaiatea in its glory and have left us descriptions, and we
have also a drawing of it. It is obvious that these structures in
no way resembled the ahu of Easter Island. Mahaiatea was
a pyramid of oblong form with a base 267 ft. by 71 ft.; it was
composed of squared coral stones and blue pebbles, and consisted
of eleven steps each some 4 ft. in height. It impressed Banks as
“a most enormous pile, its size and workmanship almost surpassing
belief.”<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a> The pyramid formed one side of a court or
square, the whole being walled in and paved with flat stones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marae, as Arii Taimai explains, were sacred to some god; but
the god was only a secondary affair; a man’s whole social
position depended on his having a stone to sit on within his
marae enclosure. Cook was asked for the name of his marae,
as it was not supposed possible that a chief could be without
one, and took refuge in giving the name of his London parish,
Stepney.</p>

<p class='c007'>Princess Takau kindly acted as interpreter when we went to
look up the Easter Islanders who came here to work on the
Brander plantation and who still form a little colony. One of
our main objects in visiting Tahiti had been to inspect the
tablets and Easter Island collection of Bishop Jaussen who died
in 1892. In this we met with disappointment; the present
authorities, whom we saw more than once, took no interest at
all in the subject, and said that on Bishop Jaussen’s death, the
Brothers had sent the articles home as curios to their friends
in Europe. They gave us an address in Louvain, which it has
not of course up to the present been possible to follow up.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Our crew underwent some alterations at Tahiti. The post of
engineer had been filled by a Chilean, and one deck hand had
already gone home as a reservist; two more now desired to
return direct to “serve their country,” one of these was
my friend Bailey, the cook. As he had had no opportunity of
spending his wages, he was, on being paid off, quite a millionaire.
He invested in a number of white washing suits and took up his
residence at our hotel. I was presented with his photograph
clad in the new raiment. An officer travelling to England from
New Zealand was kind enough to undertake to give him some
care on the journey, and managed to get him safely home,
though most of his fortune had disappeared <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i>. He took
service as a ship’s cook, and we saw his name subsequently, with
most sincere regret, in a list of “missing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bailey’s place was taken by an American, who had formed
part of the crew which had been discharged from a ship which
they had brought to Tahiti from California. He declined to
come on board till just before we sailed, as he was engaged for a
prize-fight with a noted coloured champion; the prospective
fight excited a good deal of local interest, but ended lamentably
in the white man being knocked out at the first blow. As we
were still short-handed, we arranged with our two Pitcairn
Islanders to come on with us to England; Charles Young was
signed on as deck hand, and Edwin, who was of less strong
physique, as steward. They both gave every satisfaction, and
Edwin, though he had of course to be taught his duties, was the
best steward we ever had.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had considerable conversation with our Consul, Mr. Richards,
on the subject of Pitcairn, in which he has always taken
great interest, doing all that he could for the Islanders. He had
been anxious if possible to make a stay there of some duration,
feeling, no doubt rightly, that the only way to solve its difficulties
was for someone to dwell there long enough to see the situation,
not as a visitor, but as a resident. Circumstances had not, so
far, rendered this feasible, but it is to be hoped it may still be
accomplished.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was impossible to make a direct passage from Tahiti to Panama,
as the Trade Wind would have been dead against us, we
had, therefore, to turn its flank by going as far north as the
Sandwich Group, or, to give them their American name, the
Hawaiian Islands. We passed within sight of one or two of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Paumotu group, which was our first introduction to coral atolls;
but I do not think we saw a ship during the whole voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a long run, as we met with calms in the Doldrums, and
were without the use of the motor, which stood in need of some
simple repairs, that could not be done in Tahiti. Being becalmed
is certainly unpleasant, there is no air, everything hangs loose,
rattles and bangs, and cheerful calculations are made as to how
much damage per hour is being done to the gear; but on the
whole the patience of seamen is marvellous. Occupation happily
was provided in the stupendous quantity of arrears of newspapers.
We read them most diligently, but it is hardly fair to journalists
to deal with their output a year after it is written, the mistakes
and false prophecies of even the most sober papers become
painfully obvious. We became acquainted, for example, at one
and the same time with the birth and death of the “Russian
steam-roller” theory, and other similar figments. My diary
is diversified by such items of domestic interest as “showed
Edwin how to look after the brass.” “S. taught Edwin to clean
silver.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'>HAWAIIAN ISLANDS</h4>

<p class='c018'>The group is composed of eight inhabited islands which stretch
in a line from north-west to south-east. Hawaii, the most southerly,
is the largest, and now gives its name to the whole, but the principal
modern town, Honolulu, is on the more northerly island of Oahu.
The islands were known to the early Spanish voyagers, but their
connection with the civilised world really dates from their rediscovery
by Cook. He called them after Lord Sandwich, who was at that
time First Lord of the Admiralty. The great navigator was murdered
on Hawaii in 1779. Vancouver touched there more than
once, and obtained the consent of the natives to a British Protectorate,
which he proclaimed on Hawaii in 1794; the action was
however ignored by the Home Government.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this time a powerful chief of Hawaii, Kaméhaméha I, rose
to pre-eminence. He captured the island of Oahu in 1795, and
consolidated the group under one government. Contact with the
outside world gradually undermined the native beliefs and the old
ceremonial taboos became wearisome. After the death of Kamehameha
they were overthrown by his son, in 1819, though not
without armed resistance from the more orthodox section. The
islands were for a short time “a nation without a religion”; but
Christianity was introduced almost immediately by American
missionaries.</p>

<p class='c008'>The group was nominally independent till the time of Queen
Liliuokalani, who succeeded in 1891. Her rule roused much resentment
among the foreign residents, and during a period of unsettlement
she was imprisoned in her palace for nine months. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>appeal was made to the United States, and the islands were formally
annexed by that power in 1898.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Oahu.</em>—After a five-weeks’ voyage, which included an abortive
attempt to call at the island of Hawaii, we reached Honolulu,
in the island of Oahu, on November 11th, 1915.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the isolation of Easter we had come to the comparatively
busy life of Tahiti, and now at Honolulu we felt once more in
touch with the great world. It is a cheerful and up-to-date
city in beautiful surroundings. Seen from the harbour it is not
unlike Papeete, but the town is bigger, and the mountains more
distant. The roads of the suburbs are frequently bordered by
large areas of mown grass, which form part of the gardens of the
adjacent villas. It is considered a duty to erect no wall or
paling, and the custom, while it deprives the residences of
privacy, greatly enhances the charm of the highway. The
practice is encouraged by a public-spirited society, interested
in the beauty of the place. The aquarium contains fish of most
gorgeous colouring, and it is well worth while to explore a coral
reef on the eastern shore in a glass-bottomed boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the original population, the place swarms with
Japanese, and the Americans seem little more than a ruling
caste. The natives are reported to be entirely sophisticated, and
quite competent to invent folk-tales or anything else to order.
The Bishop Museum has an interesting collection of relics and
models of the old civilisation, and we are much indebted to the
Director, Dr. Brigham, for his kindness in exhibiting them to us.
The principal treasures are the wonderful feather cloaks and
helmets of the old chiefs. Fifty men were employed for a
hundred years in collecting the yellow feathers from which one
cloak is made. The birds, which produce only a few feathers
each of the desired colour, were caught on branches smeared
with gum.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is also in the museum an excellent model of one “heiau,”
or temple; it is shown as a rectangular enclosure containing
various sacred erections. This form of heiau has no resemblance
either to the marae of Tahiti or the ahu of Easter
Island; and the art of building never seems to have approached
the excellence reached in the latter. Mr. Gordon, the British
Consul, gave us much pleasure by taking us in his motor, accompanied
by Dr. Brigham, to see the remains of one of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>temples on the eastern side of the island. Little now exists save
a rough enclosing wall. It is a matter of surprise that, under
so enlightened a government as the American, more pains are
not taken to preserve the archæological monuments throughout
the islands, which are fast disappearing. Much care is bestowed
on attracting visitors, and it would have seemed, even from the
financial point of view, that the protection of these objects of
interest would have been eminently worth while.</p>

<p class='c007'>We also visited the famous Pali, the site of a great battle at
the time of the conquest of the island by Kaméhaméha, chief
of Hawaii. A range of mountains runs along the eastern side
of the island. The visitor, approaching from the west, rises
gradually till he reaches the summit, and is then confronted by
a sheer drop of many hundreds of feet down to the coast
below.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cliff extends for many miles, and the views over land and
sea are most striking. During the invasion, the Hawaiian army
pursued the natives up the slope, and drove them headlong over
the Pali, or precipice. Kaméhaméha is the national hero; when
a statue was erected in Honolulu, to commemorate the centenary
of the discovery of the island by Cook, it was dedicated, not to
the navigator, but to the Hawaiian chief.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were accorded an interview with the ex-queen Liliuokalani.
It was a distinctly formal occasion. We were shown into a
waiting-room till some previous arrivals had finished their
audience, and were then ceremoniously introduced to royalty.
The room was furnished after European fashion, but was adorned
with feather ornaments. The old lady, who had a tattoo mark
on her cheek, sat with quiet dignity in an arm-chair. She was
obviously frail, and though she spoke occasionally in good
English, her secretary did most of the conversation. She told
us that her brother had caused certain native legends and songs
to be written down, and she herself, during her imprisonment in
1895, had translated into English an Hawaiian account of the
creation of the world. The secretary presented us with a copy
of this book. We did not gather that either of them had ever
heard of Easter Island. After a short time we took our leave,
curtseying again and backing out as we had seen done by our
predecessors. It may be remembered that Liliuokalani visited
England at the time of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee. Since our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>return we have seen the announcement of her death; so closes
the list of the Hawaiian sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being in harbour brought the not unknown domestic excitements.
The pugilistic American cook, who had been quite
satisfactory on the voyage, proved to be one of those who cannot
be in port without going “on the bust.” He was rescued once,
but he shortly afterwards asked for shore leave at 10 o’clock in
the morning. This was naturally declined; he then said he
wanted to have a tooth out. S. assured him he was quite
capable of officiating. Finding he could get neither leave,
money, nor a boat, he sprang overboard, and swam ashore
in his clothes. His place was taken by a Japanese cook from
Honolulu.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Hawaii.</em>—When the repairs to the engine had been accomplished,
we sent the yacht ahead to San Francisco, and ourselves
made a trip by steamer from the island of Oahu to that of Hawaii.
Between the two lies the island of Molokai, on which is the leper
settlement, connected with Father Damien’s heroic work and
death. We did not see the settlement itself, but from its photographs
it seems an attractive collection of small houses, in the
midst of wonderfully beautiful scenery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal sight on Hawaii is the active crater of Kilauea.
Instead of the long ride described by Lady Brassey, visitors,
landing at the port of Hilo, are now conveyed in motors to a
comfortable hotel, on the edge of the crater. We made a detour
on the way to see a genuine native settlement, where the standard
of living proved to be much the same as on Easter. The crater
itself is a subsidiary one on the side of the great mountain, Mauna
Loa; it is 4,000 feet above sea-level, and has a circuit of nearly
eight miles. The greater part of the crater is extinct, and its
hardened lava can easily be walked over, but one portion is still
active, and forms a boiling lake about a thousand feet across.
No photograph gives any idea of the impressiveness of the scene,
particularly after dark. The floor of the pit is paved with dark
but iridescent lava, across which run irregular and ever-varying
cracks of glowing gold. First one of these cracks, and then
another, bubbles out into a roaring fire, the heat melts the
adjacent lava, causing great dark masses to break off and slip
into the furnace, where they are devoured by the flames. It is
a fascinating spectacle which could be watched for hours. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>floor of the pit rises and sinks; when we were there it was some
hundreds of feet below the spectator.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kilauea was considered in olden times to be the special abode
of Pele, the goddess of fire; but after the advent of the missionaries,
her power was formally defied by Kapiolani, the daughter
of a chief who ate the berries consecrated to the deity on the
brink of the pit. More than fifty years later, however, in 1880,
there was so great an eruption of lava on the other side of Mauna
Loa that native royalty had to beseech Pele to stifle her anger
and save the people; a prayer which was, it is said, immediately
effective.</p>

<p class='c007'>We decided not to return to Hilo, but to see something more
of the island, and catch the steamer at Kawaihae on the western
side. We left the hotel at 8 a.m. and motored over a hundred
miles, first passing through grass lands and cattle ranches, and
then through sugar plantations. The way was diversified by
extraordinary flows of lava, through which the road had been
cleared: they extended for miles like a great sea; one of the
streams was as recent as 1907. The last stage of the drive was
through forest growth and coffee plantations. We spent the
night at a small hotel, kept by a lady. An interesting fellow-guest
was a government entymologist, who was combating a parasite
which was injuring the coffee; to this end he had introduced an
enemy beast of the same nature brought from Nigeria, which
was successfully devouring its natural foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below the hotel was the Bay of Kealekakua, which was the scene
of the last great drama in the life of Cook. On its shore are the
remains of the building where he was treated as the incarnation
of the god Loro. It is now only a mass of stones, but is said to
have been a truncated pyramid, which is an old form of heiau.
On the top of this temple Cook was robed in red tapa, offered
a hog, and otherwise worshipped. The conduct of the white men,
however, was such that they soon lost the respect of the natives.
An affray occurred over the stealing of one of the ship’s boats,
and Cook was stabbed in the back by one of the iron daggers
which he had himself given in barter. An obelisk has been
erected to his memory.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>On the opposite side of the bay is a “puuhonua,” or place of
refuge, by name Honaunau. It corresponded with the cities of
refuge in the Old Testament. “Hither,” says Ellis, “the man-slayer, the man who had broken a tabu,&#160;... the thief and even
the murderer, fled from his incensed pursuer and was secure.”<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c016'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
It covered seven acres, and was enclosed on the landward side by
a massive wall 12 ft. high and 15 ft. thick.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the afternoon we motored on to Waimea by a <i><span lang="la">cornice</span></i> road,
which was bumpy beyond description. The hotel consisted of
a few rooms behind the principal store. The next morning, on
the way to the steamer, we inspected two heiau, a small one at
the foot of a hill, and a large and striking one on its summit
known as Puukohola. Tradition says that the hero Kaméhaméha
set out to rebuild the former in order to secure success
in war, but was told that, if he wished to be victorious, he must
erect a temple instead on the higher altitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>The temple, which adapts itself to the ground, rises on the
seaward side by a series of great terraces and culminates on the
summit in a levelled area paved with stones. On the landward
side the building is enclosed by a great wall, on which stood
innumerable wooden idols. It was entered by a narrow passage
between high walls. On the area at the top were various sacred
buildings, including a wicker tower, out of which the priest spoke,
an altar, and certain houses, in one of which the king resided
during periods of taboo. Whilst the temple was being built,
even the great chiefs assisted in carrying stones, and the day
it was completed (1791 <em>c.</em>) eleven men were sacrificed on the
altar.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c016'><sup>[89]</sup></a> It is one of the latest, as it is one of the finest of the
heiau. From the walls are magnificent views of the two great
mountains of Hawaii, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, both over
13,000 ft.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was interesting to recognise in the Hawaiian language not
a few words similar to those which we had learnt on Easter
Island. In Polynesian the letters <span class='fss'>K</span> and <span class='fss'>T</span> are practically
interchangeable. Thus Mauna Kea, meaning Mount White,
from its usual covering of snow, is equivalent to Maunga Tea-tea,
the hill of white ash in Easter. The same is true of the letters
<span class='fss'>L</span> and <span class='fss'>R</span>. Mauna Loa is Mount Long just as Hanga Roa is
Bay Long. The identification of these last letters is not
confined to Polynesia. We made one of the Akikuyu in East
Africa repeat the same word over and over again, to see if it
had the sound of <span class='fss'>L</span> or <span class='fss'>R</span>; he used first one and then the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>without any discrimination. The names in Hawaii are said
to exist in their present form simply according to the manner
in which they have been crystallised in writing.</p>

<p class='c007'>We duly caught our steamer to Honolulu, and changed there
into the boat for San Francisco.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CALIFORNIA</h4>

<p class='c018'>Cortez, Governor of Mexico, was under the impression that America
was in close proximity to Asia. Hearing of the success of Magellan
in discovering a southern route to the westward, he sent an expedition
to the north, with the object of finding a road to India in that
direction. The members of this party, which was commanded by
Cabrillo, were the first Europeans to discover California (1542).
The native Indian population at that time is supposed to have been
about seven hundred thousand in number.</p>

<p class='c008'>For over two hundred years Spain took but little interest in the
new country; but in 1769 she began to be alarmed lest the Russians
should descend on it from the north, and its occupation was ordered
from Mexico. In this movement, not only was the secular power
represented, but Catholic missions played an important part. The
Franciscan order was first in the field; and the mission station, which
gave its name to the Bay of San Francisco, was dedicated in 1776.
Later the Dominican order also founded religious establishments.
These institutions were finally secularised in 1836, but Californians
justly regard the remains as the most romantic as well as historic
objects in the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>A wave of immigrants from the United States began to arrive
about 1841; war broke out with the parent country of Mexico in
1846; and in 1848 California was formally transferred to the States.
The same year, 1848, the first discovery of gold caused an enormous
inrush of population. The journey was no easy one; for twenty
years the would-be immigrant from the east had to choose between
the dangerous expedition overland, the unhealthy condition of the
Panama route, or a voyage round the Horn. The Pacific railway
was at last completed in 1869.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most dramatic event of recent years has been the earthquake
of 1906, which was followed by a great fire, when for three days the
city was a mass of flames.</p>

<p class='c007'>We arrived at San Francisco on December 14th, 1915. The
bay recalls in some degree that of Rio de Janeiro, the ocean has
in the same way penetrated through a narrow channel into a low
district surrounded by mountains and formed it into an inland
sea. There, however, the resemblance stops. The Bay of San
Francisco runs, for its major portion, parallel to the sea, and thus
forms a peninsula on either side of the entrance, the well-known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Golden Gate. The tract on the southern side is sufficiently level
to allow of the site of a town. The main frontage of the city is
on the bay, but it extends to the seaward side. The population
has also spread across the bay, and the suburbs have attained to
the magnitude of towns. The large ferry boats which ply across
the water are marked features of San Francisco life.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was nothing in the present fine city to recall the fact
that ten years before it had been laid low by the great fire, but
any building dating back more than a score of years is treated
with respectful interest. A professional guide, who escorts
tourists in a motor char-à-bancs, solemnly stated that such and
such houses were “in the style of thirty-five years ago,” or that
a church was “one hundred years old, but still used for service.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not, however, in such matters that the youth of California
most strikes a visitor from an older country. Its inhabitants
appear to him to resemble children who have discovered a new
playground, and who are busily occupied in seeing what each
can find there. They seem, with notable exceptions, to have
little time to spare for those deeper studies and questionings
which form part of life in lands where the earlier stage has long
been passed. There are, no doubt, in the gay crowd many profound
thinkers, numbers with unsatisfied longings and broken
hearts, but they are not obvious in the general cheerful absorption
as to how much everything costs and everybody is worth. The
stranger also, however much theoretically prepared, experiences
a shock in finding how little a population formed from manifold
races has as yet amalgamated; the owner of a shop, for instance,
may not be able to speak even intelligibly the language of the
country of his adoption. Depressing accounts were given of
the type of man who thought it worth while to take up political
life, and the consequent short-sightedness of some of the legislative
measures. We were frankly told that we were much
better off with our British monarchy, and once an American-born
citizen was even heard to regret the War of Independence.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the Great War we were told that at that time
ninety-five per cent. of the population of San Francisco were
pro-Ally, though a few professors still looked to Germany as
the home of culture. Conversation on the subject was definitely
discouraged, and one man, who spoke to us for a few minutes
concerning the struggle, ended by saying, “I have not talked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>so much about the war for months.” It was naturally impossible
to appreciate at so great a distance the feeling which pervaded
Europe. A high authority, whom we consulted as to where
we could see some Indian life, recommended us to go to a certain
German mission and “ask for hospitality from the Fathers”;
that we should prefer not to do so he obviously thought most
narrow-minded. Affairs in Mexico where some Americans had
just been killed by the insurgents were much more interesting.
Even Japan and Australia appeared more closely connected
with every-day life, and not only seemed nearer than Europe,
but than the Eastern States themselves. So was brought home
the truth of the saying that “oceans unite, not divide”; also
that the Pacific and its seaboard are really an entity, however
much the atlas may prefer to give a contrary impression. Later
it was impossible to think without deep sympathy of this young
community plunged whole-heartedly with all its fresh ardour
and keen intelligence into the solemn crucible of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>We received welcome help and hospitality from Mr. Ross, our
Consul-General, Mr. Barneson, the Commodore of the leading
yacht club, and other kind friends. Mr. Adamson, of Messrs.
Balfour &#38; Guthrie, a firm allied to our Chilean friends Williamson
&#38; Balfour, came opportunely to our assistance when the censor
felt that a cabled draft from England was too dangerous a
document to pass without many days of consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>We were naturally much interested in making the acquaintance
of our anthropological confrères of the University of California,
Dr. Waterman and Mr. Gifford, and in hearing of their important
work among the surviving Indians. A luncheon party at the
University buildings at Berkeley, one of the suburbs on the other
side of the bay, was both pleasant and enlarging to the mind.
It is a mixed university, with some five or six thousand students;
situated in beautiful surroundings and with an enviable library.
One of the guests at luncheon was a German professor, who was
at work in New Guinea when the war broke out; the account
runs that the British troops, hearing there was an expedition
in the mountains, went there expecting to encounter an armed
force. He was detained in California, unable to get home.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Christmas, the third since we left England, we spent in an
hotel on the top of Mount Tamalpais, which is on the other side
of the Golden Gate, and directly opposite to San Francisco. It
is reached by a mountain railway, and gives most beautiful
panoramic views of ocean, city, and bay. The management have
hit on the ingenious plan of pointing out special sights, by placing
tubes on the walks round the mountain, at the level of the eye,
oriented on particular places and labelled accordingly. At night
the scene is marvellous; the city appears as a blaze of illumination,
and lights in every direction are reflected in the still water of the
Bay. While on Mount Tamalpais we received a telephone
message to say that <em>Mana</em> was coming through the Gate. She
had taken two days less to do the distance from Honolulu than
a four-masted barque which left about the same time. We could
not get down before her arrival, so left Mr. Gillam to grapple
with the usual officials; and not least with the reporters,
seventeen of whom, he declared, came on board.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had had our share of the representatives of the press, but
any temptation to self-complacency would have been quenched
by the knowledge that real success in newspaper paragraphs had
already been achieved by the American cook who left in so
summary a fashion at Honolulu. He had turned up from
Hawaii and given out that he had been obliged to quit the
yacht because he “could not stand a spook ship with skulls on
board.” Except by one Christian Science reporter, scientific
research was considered dull, but this aspect of our work gave a
hope of copy; and we received a request, from more than one
agency, that we would pose for moving pictures on the deck of
the yacht exhibiting the said skulls to one another.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Pitcairn Islanders almost rivalled the cook as objects of
popular interest; as the men had nothing to gain from notoriety,
we fixed a modest sum to be given them by each reporter whom
they saw; as might perhaps have been foreseen, an interview
then appeared without any such unnecessary preliminary as a
previous conversation. Charles and Edwin told us that the life
of a great city surpassed even their expectations, but it must
be confessed that their most enthusiastic admiration was aroused
by Charlie Chaplin as he appeared at the picture palaces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Exhibition was just over, and <em>Mana</em> was moored alongside
the now deserted buildings, which even in their then condition
were well worth seeing. We had understood that there would
be no difficulty about our new cook, as he was not Chinese, and
came from an American dependency, but he was forbidden by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>the authorities to go on shore. This ruling we had, of course,
no means of enforcing; and we found also that we were liable
to a fine of over £100 if we could not produce him when we sailed.
It was not encouraging to be told that there were plenty of people
who would entice him away for a share in the fine, and it was a
relief when <em>Mana</em> at length sailed having all her crew safely on
board.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been arranged that I was to return home overland, in
order to avoid the long hot voyage on the yacht, and to put in
hand preliminary arrangements there. I left on January 16th,
taking the more southerly route across the continent. A night
was spent at Santa Barbara, to see the mission buildings which are
in the hands of one of the two remaining San Franciscan communities.
The Brother who acted as guide, and who was of
Hungarian Polish descent, said that it had been instrumental
in converting between 4,000 and 5,000 Indians. From Santa
Barbara the route runs to Los Angeles, which forms a winter
resort for various Central American millionaires. A detour was
made to the Grand Canyon, which is perhaps more impressive
than beautiful, and so to Washington. A happy time was spent
in seeing the city, and being shown over the National Museum
by Dr. Walter Hough. The objects brought from Easter by the
<em>Mohican</em> naturally proved of the greatest interest. At New York
the beautiful Natural History Museum excited admiration, and
gratitude is owed for the kindness of Dr. Lowie. At that time
we were considering the question whether, owing to war conditions,
to lay up or sell <em>Mana</em> in New York. Nothing could
have been kinder than the assistance given in my search for
information by more friends than I can mention. It was finally,
as will be seen, decided to bring her home. The crossing of the
Atlantic in an American vessel was uneventful, and on Sunday,
February 6th, 1916, I found myself, with an indescribable thrill,
at home once more in the strange new England of time of war;
which was yet the dear familiar England for which her sons have
found it worth while to fight and if need be to die.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the 20th of January, 1916, we left the harbour of San Francisco,
and proceeded to get well clear of the land, as the glass
told us to expect a blow: and in due course it came—and plenty
of it. We hove to for twenty-four hours, with oil bags to wind’ard,
for the seas were high and untrue. The weather then
moderated, so we let draw, and put her on her course, and were
soon in a more pleasant climate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Panama Canal had been closed to all traffic for many
months past, in consequence of land-slides. Of course <em>Mana</em>,
drawing but 11 feet, and only 72 feet on the water-line, would
experience no difficulty in passing, if the Administration would
permit her to do so. But would it? We had been unable to
discover, through any source in San Francisco, whether we
should, or should not, be allowed to traverse the Canal. The
only course left open to us was to go to the Isthmus and see
what could be done on the spot: if we could not get through we
must continue onwards to the S’uth’ard, and go round the Horn.
Mr. Gillam and the Owner were quite keen on doing so. Mr.
Gillam thought it was only fair to the vessel “to give her a
chance of showing what a good little ship she was.” The crew,
however, said they were quite satisfied on that point, and after
three years of it, sighed only for Britain, Beer, and Beauty. So
firmly were they convinced that our plucky Sailing-master would
take her round the Horn, just for the sake of doing so, should he
chance to come back alone without the Owner, that, when they
signed on again at Tahiti for the voyage home, it was subject
to the proviso that the outside passage round Cape Horn should
not be taken without their consent.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>So, from the so-called Golden Gate of San Francisco town, to
the real Balboa gate of the Panama Canal, sailed we in the
pious hope that something would turn up in our favour, and
believing that it would do so, for <em>Mana</em> is a “lucky ship.” And
of course that “something” did: but other events, not devoid
of interest, intervene and demand recital.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point political conditions must be referred to for the
due understanding of our story. Absurd though it be, the fact
remains that, just as England meekly allows herself to be bamboozled,
robbed, insulted, and defied by one petty <i><span lang="fr">sans-culotte</span></i>
province, so do the United States submit to like treatment from
Mexico: the same small <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δελτα</span> that represents mathematically the
consideration in which an Irishman holds the British Government,
may be said equally to symbolise the degree of respect in
which the American Eagle is held by the patriots of Mexico.
Therefore, argued we, as the noble Mexican does not hesitate to
pluck the Eagle, whenever that fowl comes hopping on his
ground, still less will he refrain from depilating the Lion, should
he want some fur for fly-tying. No, we will give the coast of
Mexico a good berth. A vessel like the <em>Mana</em> would, at the
moment, have been an invaluable capture for the “patriots,”
whose acquaintance we had no wish to cultivate. We thought of
the many-oared row-boats of the Riff coast, and how they could
come at speed over the smooth windless sea and board us on either
quarter. Of course our motor would have been in our favour,
but, all the same, discretion was perhaps better than valour, as
we were unarmed. So we decided to keep 200 miles off the land
in working down the coast of Lower California and Mexico,
though it would have been better navigation, and more interesting,
to have come close in.</p>

<p class='c007'>The climate was now delightful: smooth water: gentle fair
breezes. These conditions enabled us to capture all the turtle,
and more than all, we wanted. They were asleep at the surface:
the sea like glass, and heaving rhythmically. The undulations
of a sea like this are so long, and wide, and gentle, that one
somehow ceases to regard them as waves, and thinks of the
movement of the water immediately around the craft as being
only a local pulsation.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had noticed, from time to time, isolated seagulls heaving
into sight on the top of the swell. Sometimes there would be as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>many as three or four within calling distance from one another.
Each seemed to stand on a separate piece of drift-wood, never
two on the same piece. Some seemed occupied with affairs,
swearing all the time, as seagulls always do; some stood silently
on one leg, “a-staring into wacancy” and thinking on their
past. Some preened and oiled their feathers. We could not
understand why there should be drift-wood, all small, and all
over the place like this, so bore down on a sleeping bird, when,
to our great surprise, we found that his resting-place was the
back of one of Nature’s U-boats—a turtle. Some may think
then that all we had to do, if we wanted a turtle, was to approach
a resting bird, but not a bit of it. If the bird, for reasons of his
own, flew away from the back of the turtle, the turtle remained
as before, nor did he ever seem to draw the line at the profanity
with which his visitor argued some point with the nearest neighbours,
but let a boat approach, however gently and innocently,
and the gull decide to clear, because he did not like the look of
it—even as the bird did so, did Master Turtle down with his
head and up with his heels, and where he had been, he was not;
without a splash, or a swirl, or a bubble. If any fail to understand
this description, he should betake himself to Africa and
stalk rhino in high grass whilst they have their red-billed birds
in attendance scrambling all over the huge bodies hunting for
ticks. Let but one bird spring up suddenly in alarm from a
rhino’s back, forthwith will occur proceedings that shall not
fail to leave a lasting impression on the observer.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we wanted a turtle, however, we went to work in this
way. The little 12 ft. dinghy, having two thwarts and a sternseat,
was lowered from the starboard quarter and towed astern.
A sharp look-out was kept ahead, and to leu’ard, for a turtle
asleep on the surface. On one being sighted, the vessel was run
off towards it. Simultaneously the dinghy was hauled up
alongside, and two of us, barefooted, dropped into her: she was
then passed astern again and towed. One man sat in the stern
sheets and steered with a paddle, having handy a strong gaff
hook lashed on the end of the staff of a six-foot boat-hook: the
oarsman occupied the for’ard thwart with his paddles shipped
in the rowlocks. The leather of the oars had been well greased
previously, so as to make no sound. The dinghy silently sped
after the ship. On the vessel arriving within some 50 yards of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>the turtle, an arm on the quarter-deck was waved: the dinghy
slipped her tow line, the ship’s helm was put up, and she edged-off
to leu’ard away from the fish, whilst the dinghy continued,
under the way she carried, on the line of the vessel’s former
course, and therefore straight towards the turtle. On the sitter
catching sight of the fish, if the boat was carrying sufficient way
to bring him up to it, he laid aside the steering oar, and at the
right moment made a sign to his mate, who then gently dipped
one of his paddles in the water. The boat in consequence made
half a rotation, coming stern-on to the turtle, instead of bows-on
as previously. The oarsman then saw the fish for the first time
and commenced to back her down with gentle touches of his
two paddles right on to the top of the fish. Meanwhile the sitter
slid off the after seat, turned himself round so as to face the
stern and knelt on the bottom of the boat with his knees placed
well under the after seat, his chest resting on the transome, his
arm outstretched over the water, rigidly holding the gaff extended
like a bumpkin, with the point of the hook directed
downwards towards the water, and about two inches above its
surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the old turtle is roosting on the water with the edges of
his shell just awash, his dome-shaped back rising just clear of
it, and his head hanging downwards in order that he may keep
his brains cool. At the opposite end to his head is his tail.
This detail may seem unnecessary. But it is not so. It is an
essential point. When a turtle is surprised he does not express
it by throwing himself backward head uppermost on to his tail,
and show his white waistcoat, and wave his arms in depreciation
of the interview, but he downs with his head and ups with his
heels and the tip of his tail, if you are able to recognise it, is the
last you see of Master Turtle. And when he acts thus he shows
much decision of character: there is no hesitation: in a moment
of time he is absent. Hence, when you approach a turtle, you
must first decide where away lies his tail, and so place your craft
that her keel, and the turtle’s spine, shall lie in the same straight
line. Then, as she is backed stern foremost towards him, the
staff of the gaff is brought, by the movement of the boat, immediately
above the length of his back. Now for it! the fisherman
suddenly thrusts the gaff from him till the point of the
hook is beyond the rim of the shell: raises his hand the least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>trifle, so as to depress the hook slightly, then savagely snatches
the gaff backward, at the same time shortening his grasp on the
shaft. The turtle awakes from his dreams to find that he is in
a position in which he is helpless—standing on his tail, with his
back against the boat’s transome, and his fore flippers out of
water. But he is not given time to think. As his back touches
the flat end of the boat, the fisherman springs from his knees
to his feet and, with one lusty heave, hoicks Uncle up on to the
edge of the transome and balances him there for the moment.
Down goes the stern of the little boat, well towards water level
under the combined weight of man and fish. Then the slightest
further pull, and into the bottom of the dinghy the turtle slides
with a crash, whilst the fisherman, whose only thought now is
for the safety of his toes, gracefully sinks down upon the middle
thwart, takes hold of the gunnel with either hand, and hangs
one bare leg overboard to starboard, and the other to port, until
the turtle has decided in which part of the boat he proposes permanently
to place his head. Slowly he opens and closes his
bill, shaped like the forceps of a dentist, and slowly he blinks
his eyne, as much as to say, “Just put a foot in my neighbourhood
or even one big toe.” Turtles have no charity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The turtle and the fisherman have engrossed one another’s
attention so far, but there are three other elements in the equation;
they are (<em>a</em>) the boat, (<em>b</em>) the boatman, and (<em>c</em>) the shark.
Each of these requires a word in passing. Now a 12 ft. dinghy,
like any other of God’s creatures, has feelings: these it expresses
amongst other ways, when treated unreasonably, by capsizing,
and turtle catching it puts in the neighbourhood of the limit.
Not infrequently it happens that the long black fin of a San
Francisco pilot comes mouching around at a turtle hunt, as if
to incite the long-suffering dinghy to show temper. Hence it
is sometimes quite interesting to view, from the ship, the sympathetic
way in which the oarsman exerts himself to humour
every whim of the little boat, in order to induce it to maintain
its centre of gravity during the scrimmage. He quite seems to
have the idea in his head that, with the shark assisting at the
ceremony, a capsize would be anything but a joke for him.
Anyhow, it is all right this time, so we make for the vessel, now
gently rising high on the top of the swell, anon slowly sinking
until only her vane is visible.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>“Lee-Oh!” Round she comes. “Let the staysail bide!”</p>

<p class='c007'>As she loses her way the dinghy shoots up towards her, a line
comes flying in straightening coils from the bows of the ship
and falls, with a whack, across the dinghy’s nose. The oarsman
claps a turn with it around the for’ard thwart, and quickly gets
his weight out of her bows, by shifting to the middle thwart,
before the strain comes. At the same time the fisherman nips
aft, whilst keeping an eye on Master Turtle’s jaws, squats on the
after seat, picks up an oar and sheers her in towards the ship.
Then a strop falls into the sternsheets: the oarsman slips it over
a hind flipper, one of the dinghy’s falls is swayed to him, he
hooks it into the strop, and up runs Baba Turtle, to be swung inboard
the next moment into the arms of the Japanese cook, who
receives him with a Japanese smile as he bares his sniggery-snee.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had now been more than a fortnight at sea. After a run
of this length we generally found it well to touch somewhere to
refresh. The chart showed ahead of us the Island of Socorro
which we could fetch by edging off a little. The Sailing Directions
told us it was uninhabited, and rarely visited: that there was
no fresh water on it, but nevertheless that sheep and goats were
to be found, and that landing was possible. The early morning
of February the 5th showed its single lofty peak standing out
clearly above the lower mist, and in a line with our bowsprit,
whilst a light breeze on our quarter made us raise it fairly fast.
In the chart-room we pored over the only chart we had, a small-scale
one, using it for what it was worth to elucidate the Sailing
Directions. These indicated an anchorage and landing-place
on its south-western side: poor, but possible: and no outlying
dangers. We therefore decided to examine that coast, and see
what we could find in the way of anchorage and landing facilities.
At the same time the conversation turned on the apparent
excellence of the place as a gun-running depot for the Mexican
Revolutionaries, and the exceeding awkwardness of our position
if we suddenly shoved our nose into any such hornets’ nest.
The pow-wow finished, up the ladder we tumbled on to the
quarter-deck, and turned to the island, and lo! round a point
was emerging a something—first appearing as a boat with bare
masts—then as a boat with sails—she has presumably come out
under oars and is now getting the canvas on her. She has seen
us making for the island and is clearing out! They are at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>game, then, after all! Now she grows into a vessel under canvas:
now she fades away. No ship had we seen since getting well
clear of San Francisco. We could make nothing of her in the
haze and the mirage, for the air was all a-quiver with the heat.
The general opinion seemed to be that she was a small schooner
sailing with her arms akimbo, which, with the wind as we had
it, was impossible. Anyhow she was approaching us rapidly
in the teeth of the wind—goose-winged; but anything seems
to our mariners possible “in these ’ere fur’rin parts.” But alas
for Romance! Gradually she revealed herself through the haze
as a tramp steamer with a high deck cargo. Her black hull and
black-painted mast tops, as she opened the land and partly
showed her length, had made her the small boat with bare pole
masts: afterwards, when she shifted her helm and came towards
us bows on, she became the small schooner running before a
fair wind off the land—her light-coloured deck cargo, high built
up, and white-painted bridge formed the goose’s wings extended
on either side of the black masts, that rose above them, and
stood out distinctly against the sky. We kept our course. She
passed us close to starboard. We ran up our ensign and number
and asked her to report us, but she took no notice. Only one
man was seen aboard her. We thought at the time she was
from the Canal, but afterwards learnt that nothing had come
through it for some months, also that a somewhat similar vessel
had, in May last, lain for a month off Socorro to&#160;... admire
the Scenery.</p>

<p class='c007'>We closed with the land, at its western extremity, about
3 p.m., and then slowly ranged along the south-western shore,
examining it carefully with the glasses for indications of a landing-place.
The water was smooth and crystal-clear, and the sun
behind us, so that, comfortably ensconced in the fore-top, we
could see well ahead in the line of the ship’s progress, and to a
great depth. We were able therefore, without risk, to hug the
shore, and to examine it with precision. Everywhere was the
same low cliff: on its top, scrubby vegetation with a sheen like
the foliage of the olive—(sage-bush). Immediately below this
a broad scarlet band—(disintegrated lava)—then a greyish red,
or black, cliff wall of igneous rock—at its foot a snow white
girdle of foam from the ocean swell dashing against it.</p>

<p class='c007'>So we progressed, until we reached what we decided must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Braithwaite Bay, at the S.W. corner of the island. The Sailing
Directions gave this as the only anchorage. Mr. Gillam jumped
into the dinghy and pulled in to examine it, whilst we followed
her in very slowly with the ship. A couple of whales seemed to
find the floor of the bay quite to their taste as a dressing-room.
The huge fellows quietly spouted and wallowed, “a-cleaning of
themselves,” and took no notice of us. The dinghy did not like
the look of things for either landing or anchorage, so held up an
oar. Thereupon we put the ship round, and went out on the
same track as that on which we had entered. Nightfall was now
approaching. We picked up the dinghy and stood off a bit,
and then hove to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, immediately before reaching Braithwaite Bay, we had
noticed in the coast-line, from the mast-head, an indentation or
small inlet, across which there was no line of breakers. Also we
had observed a remarkable white patch set deeply into the land
apparently at the head of this indentation. Of these points
presently. During the night, whilst hove to some distance off,
the watch picked up a beautifully modelled painted and weighted
decoy duck, with the initials “H. T.” cut into it. This wooden
fowl, we concluded, had drifted down from San Francisco, for
there they are largely used in duck shooting. It had broken
its anchoring line, been swept through the Golden Gate, and
then by the prevailing winds and currents carried to the point
where we had picked it up. The find was interesting as showing
that our navigation was correctly based for current.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the daylight we again stood in, this time towards the
inlet, and after an early breakfast, the cutter was swung out.
A breaker of water, a cooking-pot or two, a watertight box of
food, another containing ammunition, the photographic and
botanical outfits, and a Mauser rifle in its watertight bag, were
put into her and, with five hands, we started off.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we approached the break in the cliffs we again met our
two friends of yesterday—the whales. They had shifted their
ground and were now right in the entrance to the cove, so we
had to lay on our oars for quite a while, until they gradually
moved away. It was most interesting to watch the great brutes
comparatively close alongside, yet absolutely indifferent to, or
unaware of, the boat’s presence. Certainly we kept quiet, and
did not allow objects in the boat to rattle or roll. Sound waves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>are transmitted through the water just as they are through the
air. Each of these fish would have been worth £1,000 at least
at pre-war prices. “Life is full of vain regrets.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Our break in the cliff proved the entrance to a fissure in the
land-mass comparatively far extending. On either hand it had
nearly vertical cliff walls, and these again had steep ground above
and behind them. It had a regular, gradually rising bottom,
deep water at the entrance, and at the head a shelving beach of
sand and small stones, yet steep-to enough to allow the cutter
to float with only her nose aground. Not a trace of swell: an
ideal boat harbour. As it had no name, and is to-day undefined
in the Admiralty plan of Braithwaite Bay (cf. inset on Chart
No. 1936), we christened it Cruising Club Cove—dropping the
“Royal” for the gain of alliteration.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we lay off the entrance, waiting for the whales to shift,
many, and varied, were our speculations as to what the white
object, previously referred to as situated at the head of the cove,
could possibly be. Not till we were close up did we make it out.
It then proved to be a red-painted boat, covered with a white
sail. Now a dry torrent bed forms the head of our little fiord.
The detritus brought down by the torrent is spread out as a
small, flat, channel-cut plain, that meets the sea with a fan-shaped
border. On to this flat the mystery boat was hauled
up, but only to just above high-water mark. Close to her side
was a grave with wooden cross. From her bows hung a bottle
closed with a wooden plug and sealed with red paint. Keenly
interested in it all we disturbed nothing, so that we might the
better be able to piece together the evidence, after gathering all
we could. She was evidently laid up: practically new: amateur
built: her material new deal house-flooring boards: flat-bottomed:
sharp at both ends (dory type). Left as she was, the
surf of the first gale from the South would lift her. They must
have been either weak handed to leave her close to the water’s
edge like that, or else they had been in a great hurry to get
away. No painter and anchor was laid out to prevent her
floating off: no seaman would leave a boat thus unsecured.
(For there was cordage in her.) Her sail was cut out of an old
sail of heavy canvas belonging to some big ship. They had
ship’s stores to draw upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Casting around, we soon found a track running through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>sage-bush scrub. Following this trail for a few yards, we came
to a large flat-topped rock beside which it ran. On this rock
stood conspicuously another bottle—sealed. The path now
began to rise sharply, wending betwixt large rock masses: then
it suddenly terminated in a rift in the cliff face, which formed
a high, but shallow, cave or grotto. Rough plank seats and
bunks were rigged up around, fitted under or betwixt the great
rocks, some berths being made more snug by having screens of
worn canvas. In the middle of the floor was a table, and in
the middle of the table stood a sealed bottle and a box. The
box was a small, square, round-cornered, highly ornamented
biscuit-tin of American make: it was three parts full of loose
salt, bone dry, and on the top of the salt was a wooden box of
matches, bone dry and striking immediately. We emptied the
salt on to the table—nothing amidst it: we broke the bottle
and we found in it a scrap of paper. On this was written in
ink, a surname, the day of the month and year, the full initials
of the writer and these words, “Look at our Post Office here.”<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c016'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
We then returned to the flat rock and broke that bottle—the
message was the same; then to the boat, to find the message
in its bottle was identical in terms, but written in pencil.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Look at our Post Office</em>”—But where was the Post Office? or
what was the Post Office? The fragments of the broken bottle
lay glittering on the grave at our feet. Was the grave the Post
Office?</p>

<p class='c007'>We had most carefully examined and sounded the cave, and,
after our long experience of this class of work on Easter Island,
felt fairly satisfied that the Post Office was not there. Every
fire site we had suspected and inspected: every sinkage of the
surface. Now we had to decide about the grave. The character
of the vegetation showed that it was old, and had not been
disturbed within the date stated on the letters. A Spanish
inscription in customary form, cut very neatly into the arms
of the wooden cross, gave simply the name of the dead man, and
the date. At one time the cross had been painted black. The
point however that determined us to accept the burial as <i><span lang="fr">bona
fide</span></i>, and not to exhume it as a possible cache, was the fact that
the sharp edges of the carving of the inscription were smoothly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>rasped away by the driving sand of the shore, in the direction
of the prevailing wind, and to a degree commensurate with
the date incised. And we were right in our surmises. Sufficient
now to say that he whom the writing told to go to the Post
Office, was already lying in his own grave elsewhere, with
his boots on, and no cross at his head. Life is held cheap in
Mexico.</p>

<p class='c007'>The island is said to possess no fresh water. We found no
provision made in the cave for conserving a supply. Scrambling
through the sage-bush we made for the dry torrent. Here we
found one of the channels had been diverted, and in it sunk a
well or shaft, some ten feet deep, with fine soil at its bottom.
The end of a rope just showed for about one foot above the surface
of the silt at the bottom of the shaft. Near by was a rough
cradle and makeshift gear for gold washing. They had been here
during the rains, and the torrent had supplied the washing water.
Thinking of a possible sealed bottle placed in the shaft bucket
at the end of the rope, we left two hands there with orders to
follow the rope carefully down to its termination and see what
was on the end of it. The cutter with two hands we sent back
to the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>We and one hand—a Russian Finn who had been for some
years on the Alaska Coast—then set off inland to see what the
world was like, and to get a sheep if possible. By this time the
heat had become very great. The soil—yellow volcanic ash—soaked
up the sun’s rays and then threw the heat back as would
a hot brick. Everything was so dry that we marvelled that
vegetation could hold its own. We saw no form of grass, but
the surface was generally covered with sage-bush extending
from the level of the knee in general to above one’s head in the
bottoms. We had scrambled up the ravine from our pirates’
cave and up the steep ground around it. We now found ourselves
on a well-defined ridge that ran parallel to the sea, with a breeze,
though a hot one, in our faces, and a glorious view of sea, coast-line,
and mountain. Our whales were clearly visible far away
in the bight to the west’ard, whilst to the nor’ard lay the great
mass of an unnamed volcano, with its top lost in mists, its sides
sweeping downwards, with typical curvature, till they reach the
sea. We gave the mountain the name of Mount Mana. It is
3,707 ft. high. Much information about it will appear some day.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Between the ridge on which we now stood, and the well-defined
foot of Mount Mana opposite to us, was a valley some half a mile
wide. We made our way across this valley as far as the mountain’s
foot, in order to cut across any tracks, human or ovine,
that might pass down it, because they would tell us the news,
like a file of newspapers—for all movement on the island would
pass along this bottom. Here the sage-bush was very strong
and high, and we found it difficult to get through. It frequently
was tunnelled where it was thick, reminding one of hippo paths
leading to the water. In the present case, however, bits of the
fleeces of the makers were clinging to the sides of the tunnel.
The only signs of man were the brass shell of an exploded military
cartridge, and a few heads and horns of sheep lying where the
beasts had been shot. Here and there along the course of the
valley, masses of black volcanic rock, bare of vegetation, rose
above the bright yellow soil and its sage-bush covering. The
surface of the plain and of the mountain’s base were also punctuated
by isolated specimens of a species of fig (<em>ficus cotinifolia</em>)
having a dark green fleshy leaf somewhat like that of the magnolia,
and a number of separate trunks or stems. These trees,
like all else, were dwarf and stunted, and about 15 feet high.
Every tree formed a flattish roof, as it were, supported on many
pillars and impervious to the sun. It was delightful to rest for
a short while under each as we came to it for a brief respite from
the shimmering heat. Beneath them the ground was bare and
smooth. The sheep tracks and tunnels led from tree to tree,
and it was evident that the sheep made it their practice to rest
on these shady spots, during the heat of the day. Whilst so
resting ourselves, we were amused and interested by several
little birds of different sorts. They chummed up en route, and
kept close to us wherever we went, flitting from bush to bush,
and when we sat down in the shade, sidled along the branches
till they got as close to us as they could, short of absolutely
alighting upon us. They acted just as native children do
towards the white man when they have got over their first
shyness. Working up wind, we soon found sheep; they were
in small bunches varying from three to perhaps a dozen. We
got a couple, though both getting up to the game and the shooting
was difficult in such cover, and resolved itself into snap-shots
as they followed their tracks across the occasional isolated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>masses of dark basalt that rose above the yellow soil and which
supported no vegetation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having gralloched our victims and slung the carcases well up
on to our shoulders, with both breast strap and brow strap,
Micmac fashion, we started back for Cruising Club Cove. It
was now about noon, and as a direct line seemed feasible, we
decided to take that line. The better road along the sheep
tracks, and therefore through their tunnels, along the bottom
of the valley, was impossible for a laden man. We did it!
Across the valley, often brought to a standstill by scrub that
would not yield when leant against. Up the hill side to its
delusive gap, often on hands and knees. Down the steep pitch
on the other side, with bump and crash, regardless of scratches,
thinking only of how to avoid a broken leg or twisted ankle.
Then a final wrestle with scrub in the ravine bottom and we were
on the shore. What a relief to throw up that brow strap for the
last time and to let the mutton fall, with a thump, on the stones!
Then off with what remained of our clothes, with which we
draped the bushes to dry, and into the tepid shallow water,
shallow for fear of sharks. Orders were given that whilst bathing
a good fire of scrub wood should be made on a spot sheltered
from the sun by the side of a lofty rock. On that fire’s glowing
cinders when nearly burnt out we presently grilled kidneys of
peculiar excellence, and boiled the billy, and thanked the Immortal
Gods.</p>

<p class='c007'>The examination of the dry shaft, which was the job of the
two hands left behind, was never made. They reported that
soon after beginning work the side of the shaft fell in. On
looking at it, it was clear that we could not now do anything
there. So we hunted around again, collecting seeds, and plants,
and rock samples. Presently, amongst the drift material at
storm high-water mark, we came across a cube of wood 12 or
15 inches square: (the end of a baulk of timber sawn off):
through it was bored an auger hole, and a rope rove. The end
of the rope passed through the block was finished with a “Stopper”
knot, a knot known only to seamen. Its other end had
one long single strand that had been <em>broken</em>: the other two
strands were shorter than the first by some two feet. They had
been <em>cut through</em>. The story was clear. We only wanted a
name, and—<i><span lang="la">mirabile dictu</span></i>—we have it. Turning over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>block, on one face is deeply cut in letters some three inches long
the words ANNIE LARSEN. Pussy is out of the bag!</p>

<p class='c007'>For the benefit of those who are not shippy yachty devils, we
will now explain. When you drop your anchor at any spot
where the nature of the bottom is such that you may, perhaps,
not be able to lift it again by heaving on the chain in the ordinary
way, because the anchor has fallen amongst rocks, or into some
mermaid’s coral cave, under such circumstances it is customary
to fasten one end of a rope to the end of the anchor opposite to
that to which the chain is attached (<em>i.e.</em> to the crown), and to
the other end of the rope you make fast a buoy—you “buoy
your anchor.” Then, “when the sour moment comes” to take
a heave, and you have heaved in vain, you pick up your anchor
buoy, and haul on its rope, and up comes your anchor without
a struggle, like Cleopatra’s red herring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our find told us that it belonged to a ship of moderate size,
for her anchor was of moderate weight, because the anchor rope
was of moderate strength; and that that ship was probably
a sailing ship, because she had no steam winch: for steamers
don’t usually buoy, having immense steam heaving power. She
had not intentionally left it; the rope had had two strands cut
through by the sharp rocks of the bottom, then the third strand
had torn apart from strain, and the buoy, with its short length
of rope, drifted away, to be ultimately thrown up above ordinary
high-water mark during a gale. Like the duck, it might have
come down from San Francisco! Not so. The two cut strands
had not been long in the water after they had been cut before
they were thrown up high and dry.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was very compromising for Annie. Of course we immediately
asked, “Anyone know the <em>Annie Larsen</em>?” The Russian
Finn, naturally <i><span lang="fr">au courant</span></i> with all the coast scandal after a
month in San Francisco, was immediately able to inform us that
the <em>Annie Larsen</em> was an American schooner of about 300 tons,
and was in the Mexican gun-running line till captured so laden
by a U.S.A. ship of war only a month ago whilst we were at
San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c007'>So we had got to the bottom of things after all, though we had
failed to find the Post Office! Socorro Island was the depot
for the late Yankee gun runner <em>Annie Larsen</em>: the special, little-used
boat was for shipping, not for landing, the stuff: the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Mexicans had come and fetched it away in their own craft as they
got the chance. Some of the <em>Annie Larsen</em> crowd, being old
Alaska hands, had prospected the ravine for gold, Alaska fashion.
It was not a case of shipwrecked men on a waterless island.</p>

<p class='c007'>The afternoon was now getting late: <em>Mana</em> stood boldly in
close to the entrance of the cove. She lowered her cutter, the
shore party were soon on board again, and at 5.35 p.m. (6.2.16)
we bore away for Hicaron Island at the entrance to the Gulf of
Panama, S. 69° E., distant 1,834 miles. As we watched the
island fade in the dusk, we thought we had done with Socorro
for ever; but it was not thus written. Some six months after
our visit a man was arrested at Singapore as a spy, and there
detained in prison. That man was the writer of the message
in the bottle. In prison he chanced to get hold of a piece of a
local newspaper, and that particular number happened to have
in it an account of the voyage of <em>Mana</em> taken from the London
papers. It incidentally mentioned that she had touched at
Socorro. A ship then had been to his island! What had we
found? How much did we know? <em>Had we found the Post
Office?</em> On release he made his way to England to find out.
But now is not the time to tell the story: we are bound for
Panama, or for Cape Horn—for better or for worse—for heat
or for cold. Chance, however, at this time, all unknown to us,
had decided our fate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rainy season was now approaching, and we even got an
occasional warning shower, which made us all the more anxious
to reach the Isthmus, and get clear of it, before its unhealthy
season set in. But our progress was slow: we could not run the
main engine continuously, as we only had a small supply of
lubricating oil adapted to the great heat. That with which we
had been supplied at San Francisco proved useless. Also we
had long before unwisely sent back to England the light canvas
and all its gear, in order to get more stowage room. In doing so
we thought we would be able to run the ship under power in
light airs, and therefore would not want it: ’twas an error.
However, we always made something, for if she did not do her
50 miles in the 24 hours, we unmuzzled the motor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our engineer, Eduardo Silva of Talcahuano, a Chilean, was a
most excellent young fellow: always keen and willing: always
grooming his three charges, the engines of the yacht, the life boat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>and the electric light, and ever ready to run them, despite the
terrible heat in the engine-room. Sometimes when the big
38 h.p. motor had a fit of the tantrums, because it could not get
cold water from the sea quickly enough to assuage its body’s
heat, and he durst not leave it, he would eventually appear
on deck, as pale as a sheet, and completely done. On one such
occasion he reflectively remarked, as the two of us looked down
into the engine-room from the deck, “All same casa del diablo.”<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c016'><sup>[91]</sup></a>
He did not exaggerate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day followed day. We gradually gnawed into our 1,834
miles. The Russian Finn came to the fore as a keen sportsman:
from tea-time to dusk he was generally to be found somewhere
outside the vessel’s bows: sometimes on the bowsprit end,
sometimes standing on the bob-stay, regardless of the fact that
a shark was very frequently in attendance on us in the eddy
water under our counter. Looking over the taffrail you could
see the brute weaving from side to side as does a plum-pudding
carriage dog at his horses’ heels. One experienced a sort of
fascination in watching these great fish at night, their every
movement displayed by the luminosity of the water, until they
themselves, on occasion, seemed to glow with the phosphoric
light. <em>Mana</em> in these waters generally had shoals or companies
of small fish in attendance on her, amongst which were always
a few larger ones. We got to know individuals by sight. We
thought they kept to her for protection. It certainly was not
for what they could get off her copper. With that we never
had any trouble: it kept as bright as gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>One night we were asleep on the locker in the deck-house
companion, and were awakened by an unholy struggle and crash.
Nipping out, we found the Russian on look-out for’ard, regardless
of the sleepers below him, had leant over her bows and had
actually hoiked out with a gaff hook a large porpoise. It
seemed impossible to believe that a man could have had the
physical strength to hoist such a mass bodily out of the water, up
her high bow, and over the rail. He seems to have fairly lifted
it out, by the scruff of its neck, as it rushed alongside after the
fish.</p>

<p class='c007'>He only fell overboard once: that was on the voyage from
the Sandwich Islands, when we were not aboard. On reaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>San Francisco he brought a note from Mr. Gillam to us at our
hotel to report arrival. We of course inquired as to their
voyage. The Russian said it had been quite the usual thing:
nothing had happened out of the common. Long afterwards
he casually informed us that on that run, when he went forward
one night from the quarter-deck to the galley to make the coffee
for the change of watch at midnight, he went first to do some
job on the top-gallant-fo’c’s’le head, and got knocked overboard.
En route to the land of never-never he found the weather jib-sheet
in his hand, and by it was able to haul himself aboard again.
As he was supposed to be in the galley, he would never have been
expected to show for half an hour, and therefore would not have
been missed until the watch mustered. It did not seem to
occur to him that he had had a bit of a squeak. He did not get
wet, so nobody knew, for he told no one. As an angel, perhaps
there was a certain amount of black down underneath his white
plumage, but as an A.B. one wished for no better. He was the
second of <em>Mana’s</em> company to be killed by the Huns after our
return.</p>

<p class='c007'>After heaving-to like this, to let the reader into some of the
little humours of our domestic life, we must get under way again.
Well, everybody seemed quite happy and contented “on this
’ere run”: fish, birds, weird ocean currents and their slack
water areas with accumulated drift, sail-mending, turning out
and painting the fo’c’s’le, with life on deck, instead of below,
for a few days, a threatened blow that never reached us, but
only sent along its swell to justify the actions of the glass, and
the ever-varying incidents associated with life on a small craft
in unfrequented tropical seas, for we never saw another sail,
made us so forgetful of the flight of time, that it seemed that
we had but left Socorro, before we found ourselves off Hicaron
Island, our prearranged landfall. Thirty-one days had faded
away like a dream (map, facing p. 359).</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, close to the Island of Hicaron lies another one much
larger. We had a plan of it, Coiba or Quibo Island. The
Sailing Directions said “turtles abound, but they are hard to
catch.” (We didn’t want any more turtle!) “Crabs, cockles,
and oysters are plentiful. In the woods monkeys and parrots
abound, and in Anson’s time, 1741, there were deer, but the
interior is nearly inaccessible, from the steepness of the cliffs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>and the tangled vegetation: explorers should beware of alligators
and snakes.” The chart showed an excellent anchorage and
indicated fresh water. It seemed promising: we would see
what it was like. We were particularly desirous of now making
good our expenditure of water, as we did not know what were
the conditions we might find prevailing at Panama both as regards
its quality and the facilities for getting it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had sighted Hicaron Island at daylight on Monday, the 6th
of March, 1916, but calms, baffling airs, and currents prevented
our making our proposed anchorage by daylight. At dusk,
therefore, we hove to for the night. <i><span lang="la">Festina lentiter</span></i> was ever our
motto. We had the most recent chart certainly, but its last
correction was in 1865 and coral patches grow quickly. Not
until noon next day did we get abreast of Negada Point, the
S.E. extremity of Quibo Island. As the coast was charted
free from dangers, we came fairly close in, and starting the motor
about one o’clock, ran along the shore under power, with a look-out
in the fore-top.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was very interesting and pleasant, after a month at sea,
thus to coast along the fringe of a tropical island: sweeping
round rocky points of the land, and peeping into lovely little
coves fringed with white coral sand that merged into a dense
tropical vegetation, with hills in the background. It soon
becomes instinctive to keep the sharpest of look-outs ahead,
<em>i.e.</em> into the clear water, for a change of colour indicating danger,
and yet to see everything around. The most memorable feature
of this particular afternoon was the large number of devil-fish
that were seen springing into the air: as many as three or four
might be observed within as many minutes. Suddenly, near
or far, a large object, like a white-painted notice-board, shot
vertically into the air to considerable height, to fall back again
on its flat with resounding spank and high-flying spray, leaving
a patch of milky foam on the smooth blue surface of the water.
In British seas this family of fishes is represented by the skate.
Here they attain the dimensions of a fair-sized room: a specimen
in the British Museum from Jamaica measures 15 ft. by 15 ft.
and is between three and four feet thick, hence the statement
that “their capture is uncertain and sometimes attended with
danger”<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c016'><sup>[92]</sup></a> is probably not far from correct. Perched aloft,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>and thus having a large and unobstructed horizon, we saw one
jump probably every ten minutes throughout the afternoon.
The motor brought us to our anchorage, and at 5 o’clock we let
go in 9 fathoms, sand and mud, the shore distant about 1½
miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had seen hitherto no sign of the island being occupied,
nor did we now. After dark, however, at two widely separated
points, a fire blazed up and lights showed for a short while.
Smoking on deck, when dinner was finished, we speculated as to
the meaning of the different mysterious grunts and gurgles,
sighs and plunges, that stole over the tepid oily water: the
tropical sea after dark seemed to have voices as many and
varied as the tropical forest has when the sun is gone. From
6 p.m. onward the thermometer read 87° F.: at 6 a.m. it had
fallen to 83°—the cool of the morning!</p>

<p class='c007'>With the daylight a single pirogue, with two men in her, came
alongside. She was a small and roughly made dug out, very
leaky. In the wet of her bottom lay a bunch of bananas, perched
on which were a couple of large macaws. Each of these had a
strip of bark some two feet long tied to its leg. The bunch of
bananas lay like an island above the water in her: on to it as a
refuge the parrots crawled. Their jesses entangled amongst the
bananas—the boat rolled—so did the banana bunch—each bird
would climb upwards, but he could not, the accursed thong held
him down: he was being crushed, he was being drowned—he
and his mate. And each said so. An American mining captain
taking up his parable was not in it with those birds for language.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two men were negroid in feature. One of them had only
one leg, and seemed sad and ill. The other was more cheerful.
We could get along together in Spanish. They invited us to
come ashore. Hoisting out the cutter, we followed them in.
Their lead was useful, as the water is so shoal. Though the rise
and fall is but small feet, yet a large area of coral rock flats is dry
at low water on either side of a boat channel. At the entrance
to this channel an open sailing boat, some 25 feet long, their
property, lay at anchor. As the tide was falling, we thought it
best to leave our cutter at anchor in sufficiently deep water for
her not to take the ground, and got our friends to ferry us from
her, one by one, into shoal water in their canoe. It was most
comic to see some of our big chaps kneeling on the bottom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>the crazy little craft with a hand on either gunnel, whilst they
bent forward, like devout Mussulmans on their carpets, endeavouring
to get their centre of gravity as low as possible. We were
the last of the passengers. When the water got to be only
knee deep the native anchored his canoe, and we stepped overboard.
So did our one-legged ferryman. His right hand
controlled a crutch, in his left he held various treasures obtained
from <em>Mana</em>; he also desired to take his two big parrots ashore,
so, as the last item of all, he hooked his finger under the cord
that tied them together, thus carrying them swinging heads
downwards. But apparently he had not taken the cord fairly
in the middle. One parrot was suspended by a short length of
line: the other by a long: he of the short cord was able to twist
himself round and get a hold with his beak on some package in
his owner’s hand, and was thus reasonably happy. But parrots,
like ourselves, can’t have it all ways in this world of woe. If
his head be up, his tail must be down: hence this tale. He of
the long string found himself draggling in the water with every
stride of his one-legged owner. In his struggles to avoid drowning
by a succession of dips, he managed at last to grasp, with beak
and claw, the long dependent tail of his fellow prisoner, and
quickly hauling himself up it, he at once proceeded to consolidate
his position, by seizing in his beak the softest part of his colleague’s
hinder anatomy with the vice-like grip of despair, and therefrom
he continued to depend in placid comfort, regardless of the
other’s piercing shrieks and protestations.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not always those at the top of the ladder that have the
best time of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A wide shore line of white sand met us. On it at high-water
mark were large quantities of white bleached drift-wood trees.
On the flat ground behind, beneath a dense tree growth, were
some small pools of stagnant rain water, a few coconut palms
were dotted about—all else was jungle. On a patch cleared of
undergrowth stood a light frame structure open on all sides.
The roof was high pitched and had wide eaves: there was no
attempt at a floor. It might be 30 ft. by 20 ft. Smaller similar
structures adjoined for cooking and stores. A box or two,
baskets, hammocks, and a little boat-gear, were suspended from
the beams above: a few wooden blocks for stools were on the
earthen floor, which was neatly swept. On one such sat a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>terribly afflicted specimen of humanity—the mother, yet nevertheless
dignified and courteous. The father, a spare little man
with an intelligent face, lay in his hammock and extended his
hand feebly over the side simply saying that he was “infirma.”
He seemed to avoid making any movement. Four or five
children of various ages moved listlessly about; only one of
them, a girl of ten or twelve years of age, seemed quite healthy.
Then there was the one sound man from the pirogue and the
cripple. The whole family were being slowly destroyed by fever
and elephantiasis, and apparently must, before long, perish from
lack of ability to gather food. No resources were visible—though
no doubt they had a little cultivated ground somewhere handy,
and of course there was always fish. The whole story of gradually
encroaching disease and suffering was so easy to read, and the
patient and hopeless resignation with which the little group
awaited its predestined extinction was very pathetic. They
uttered no complaint nor asked for anything. We made the
best of things, and got them quite cheerful and interested, producing
from time to time various trifles from our pockets which
we generally carried with us as presents when going ashore.
Anxious to please, they gave us various quaint shells and a little
fruit, and again pressed on our acceptance the hapless macaws,
now secured to a handy branch, whose bedraggled plumage and
sorry mien seemed quite in keeping with the surroundings.
Altogether our visit seemed to give our hosts pleasure. The
man appeared to have some Spanish blood in him and to have
known better days. We then returned to the ship, and had
breakfast, sending back by the pirogue, which had returned with
us, a little present of ship’s biscuit, tinned meat, cigarettes, and
quinine. It was obvious that no watering was feasible at this
landing-place. They told us we should be able to get water at
the other spot where we had seen a light the evening before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pulling in the heat and sun any considerable distance was out
of the question, so we hoisted out the motor lifeboat launch,
taking the cutter in tow for landing. We found another wide
sandy beach, but with fairly deep water right up to it. There
was sufficient breaking swell on it to require the cutter to be
hauled up smartly, directly her nose touched, or the next sea
would have knocked her broadside on and filled her. The shore
was bordered by what appeared to us, from its state of neglect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>to be a deserted coconut plantation. We however told the
men not to swarm up for nuts for the present—there are generally
some low easily climbed trees—until we found out how the
land lay. The white man never seems to be able to understand
that petty plundering of native plantations is a bad introduction.
Needless to say that it was not many minutes before the irrepressible
Finn had “found on the ground” a bunch of green
nuts and was devouring them with the avidity of a land crab.
Foot-prints on the shore, and trails through the scrub, soon
brought us to a group of shanties under the palm trees, and
therefore close to the shore line. The coconut palm seems to
thrive best just beyond high-water mark, and on any flat at
about that level behind the furthest point reached by the water.
Trees are often to be seen with the soil round their roots partially
washed away on one side of the trunk.</p>

<p class='c007'>A white man came walking along the shore to meet us. Of
course the first thing we did was to apologise for the unseemly
sight of the men all feeding on his nuts. He was fairly cordial,
but evidently greatly perplexed as to who, and what, we were.
We told him as well as we could about the ship and the reason
of our visit, but it was obvious he thought we lied. All the
same he gave us the information we wanted as to supplies and
water. Practically nothing was to be had. As it would be
shortly our men’s dinner hour, we persuaded him to come with
us aboard, and he thawed considerably under the influence of
luncheon. He told us the coco palms had been planted by his
father, and that his name was Guadia. The Sailing Directions,
as to this place, are quite wrong. Moreover, they seldom quote
their authority, or the date of the information they give, which
renders them very untrustworthy.</p>

<p class='c007'>About twenty fever-stricken natives, many of them cripples
from elephantiasis, live here permanently on the plantation
under the flimsy shelters. Sr. Guadia said he lived usually in
the city of Panama, but came over for some months during the
healthy season, occupying a somewhat superior hut in the midst
of the native shacks. There are comparatively high hills close
to hand, that would be infinitely more healthy as a residential
site. He will probably get infected from the natives. The
mosquitoes pass the disease along.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the watering scheme had broken down, we thought we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>would devote the afternoon to fishing. Sr. Guadia said that,
if we really wanted fish, we ought to go to the mouth of a river
some distance away, but that the bottom was all clean opposite
his camp, so we thought we would take a few drags of the seine
along his front. We faked it down into the cutter and the
launch towed her in. All along the beach the water was almost
soup-like from the mud in suspension, also in it floated, in immense
quantity, tiny fragments of fine marine grasses, the whole
being kept constantly churned by the swell. In this opaque
water fish could not see the net. Casting off from the launch
the cutter backed into the beach: one hand jumped ashore with
the head and foot ropes. She then described a semicircle as
she shot her net: our seine was 50 fathoms long and 2 fathoms
deep: as she completed the semicircle by touching the beach
the spare hands jumped ashore with the other head and foot
ropes and the boat pulled away to the launch to land that party,
for without them it was impossible to haul the net: the resistance
was far too great. The natives—the whole population
of the huts—grouped themselves together at a little distance,
but never offered to lend a hand. At last we got a move on the
net, but the resistance was excessive, and we were afraid that
she had picked up something. Gradually however the line of
buoying corks rose to the surface as the leaded foot rope took
the ground, defining the semicircle with a row of dots, whilst
over them jumped, at various points of the most distant part
of the curve, a multitude of small fry, like a stream of silver
darts, and with rainlike patter as they struck the water. Gradually
the escaping captives became larger and larger, springing
high into the air, and we thought that we should find but little
left when we got the net ashore, for the weight in it was such
that we could move it but slowly. “Keep her up!—Keep her
up!”—was now the cry, to counteract the tendency to haul on
either head rope or foot rope unduly in the excitement of the
finish—for a seine is simply a moving vertical wall of net, and
must be maintained as such in use. At last the contained area
began to simmer: then to boil: and then, still hauling evenly,
we brought the mass more or less upon and against the sandy
beach. Practically it was solid fish: fish of every size, shape
and colour. There was comparatively little weed. By their
very number they had been rendered helpless. This was great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>good luck, for amongst them was a large shark some ten or
perhaps twelve feet long, and another brute of about the same
size and weight, but he chiefly consisted of head, and his head
chiefly consisted of mouth. When this mouth, with two little
eyes at the sides, looked at you, the shark seemed of benevolent
appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course our first thought was for the safety of the net; that
it was not burst or torn already seemed a miracle. The struggles
of the two great brutes would tear it to pieces if we tried to haul
them right ashore, so we just held them jammed against the
sloping beach. The natives then cautiously ventured to attack
them with their machettes—a powerful slashing knife, like a
small sabre, used for clearing the forest growth. They directed
all their efforts to slashing them along the spine: gingerly
approaching the fish by the head, they inflicted the wounds
nearer and nearer towards the tail. Having paralysed that,
they then blinded them. They did not desire to kill: they
wanted the fish to have enough life left in it to be able to struggle
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus paralysed our two largest captures, we slipped
a bowline round their tails, and dragged them clear of the net,
and started them off, when they were at once torn to pieces by
their fellows. We then proceeded to collect the useful part
of the catch. We took what we wanted: the natives appropriated
the rest. These natives were not an attractive lot—neither
the men, the women, nor the children—they would not
lend a hand to haul, got three-quarters of the catch for picking
it up, and then tried to steal the balance that we had reserved.
Sr. Guadia gave us some coconuts, and the antlers of a deer
that he had shot: according to him they are plentiful on the
island.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we didn’t want anybody to get bitten by mosquitoes, and
sunset was approaching, the order was now “All aboard the
lugger!” and we reached the ship as her riding-light ran up.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our job was now to get to the entrance of the Canal, which is
situated at the bottom of the bight of the Gulf of Panama. It
is a most difficult one for a sailing vessel. Roughly speaking,
currents from the south-east may be said to sweep round its
coasts, and to form of the Gulf one vast eddy. Here, throughout
the year, persist calms and catspaws from all directions, rain,
lightning, and squalls: the whole caboodleum of the Doldrums,
plus a complex tangle of irregular currents. In addition to the
foregoing joys, there is, towards the head of the Gulf, a large
area studded with islands, rocks, and coral patches. From this
archipelago have been obtained, from the earliest times, at the
price of infamous cruelty, a large supply of the finest pearls—the
group is called the Pearl Islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A vessel unaided by steam power will experience considerable
difficulty and delay in getting out of Panama Bay,” say the
Sailing Directions. She will: and so she does in getting into
it. There is a well-known yarn of a ship being here carried
round and round for a year or so, in the olden days, until her
people had nearly all perished from scurvy. Some of the
American newspapers got hold of this story and said we had
found and relieved her, giving pathetic details. In our case,
though we had a motor that gave us 5½ knots through the water,
we found that our only course was to allow ourselves to be
carried right across the mouth of the Gulf to the Colombian coast,
and then to work up along the coast of the Isthmus of Darien,
<em>i.e.</em> along the eastern shore of the Gulf of Panama.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following summary of our log will show what things are
like. We left Fea Harbour, Quibo Island, at 8.10 a.m. on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Thursday, March the 9th, and motored until noon. Then got the
canvas on her. Light airs: E.; N.N.E.; N.; S.S.E.; S.E.b.E.
between noon and midnight. Made good 17½ miles. Much
lightning all around in the first watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The middle watch of Friday the 10th had easterly airs that
gave her an average of three knots, and much lightning. At
9.50 a.m. started motor and ran it until 0.50 p.m.; and again
from 3.24 p.m. to 5.45 p.m. Notwithstanding our using power,
it was 10 p.m. before the light on Cape Mala could be entered
in the log as just dipping. The motor was only called upon
when the current was setting her into what would be a dangerous
position. This day we make good 38½ miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Saturday, the 11th of March, we found there was a strong
s’utherly set at 11 a.m., and a N.N.W. breeze, so, instead of steering
to Panama, we altered course to take full advantage of the
breeze to cross the Gulf. We passed from time to time well-defined
current-ripples, with much rubbish floating in the dead
water. During the afternoon the water became very dark and
discoloured, but we got no bottom at 225 fms. At 10 p.m.
however we got 55 fms., so we hove to and waited for the
daylight. Our day’s run was 79 miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>At earliest daylight on Sunday the 12th we bore away and
at 7.15 a.m. made Cape Escarpado bearing N.42°E. The morning
was very hazy with much mirage, and the land very difficult to
recognise at any distance. We were now working to wind’ard
to the entrance of the Pearl Islands. At 1.35 p.m. we started
the motor, and at 4.50 p.m. brought up for the night in 13 fms.
between Monge and Puercos islets, which lie off the east coast
of the large Isla del Rey. We have done 60 miles to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday, the 13th of March, we made a start at 5 a.m., under
sail, working against light airs from N.N.W. westerly. We were
now being swept up into the Bight of Panama by the current,
so all we had to do was to keep her nicely placed. At noon,
when we were distant from Canal entrance 48 miles, we were
obliged to start the motor, and did 16 miles under power, stopping
it at 3.26 p.m. We then got a gentle N.W. breeze, which we
kept till 11.40 p.m., when we brought up off the entrance of the
Canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early the next morning a harbour launch, with the Port
Officials, came out to us. They told us that the Canal had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>closed to all traffic for five months. According to them, our
chance of being allowed to pass through was small indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as we had got pratique, we started in our launch for the
shore, to learn our fate. From the Port of Balboa on the Pacific,
to the Port of Colon on the Atlantic, is 44 miles by canal: by sea
the distance is 10,500. If the Powers that Were would not let
us through, we must practically again circumnavigate the whole
continent of South America. We had already done it once to
a very large extent: Pernambuco to Valparaiso. Was it to be
our fate to do it a second time?</p>

<p class='c007'>Though <em>Mana</em> was anchored close to the entrance of the
fairway, yet she was hull-down on our looking back when we
were abreast of the Balboa frontage, so great is the length of the
dredged channel through the smooth shoal water of the Bay,
before the Canal begins to have visible land on either side of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Messrs. Balfour, Guthrie &#38; Co., of San Francisco, had most
kindly advised their agents of our being <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i>, and consequently,
when we landed at Balboa, there was a motor-car in
waiting. We whisked off, got fresh meat and vegetables for the
ship, put it aboard the launch, and despatched her with orders
to return to take us off an hour before dark. Then we drove
straight to the City of Panama to call on the British Minister,
Sir Claud Mallet. He was most kind. He sent us under convoy
of the Consul to see Colonel Harding, the acting chief of the
Canal in the absence of Colonel Goethals. Colonel Harding was
pleased to grant <em>Mana</em> the exceptional privilege of at once passing
through the Canal, on the ground that she was a scientific research
ship,—a favour for which we owe much gratitude both
to him and to the Government which he represented. We have
sometimes however regretted this stroke of luck, as, had we
been compelled to take the s’utherly route, we should have been
at Punta Arenas just at the time Sir Ernest Shackleton was there
seeking a vessel to rescue his men from Elephant Island, a job
for which <em>Mana</em> was eminently fitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In accordance with arrangements made, next morning a pilot
came off and took us, under our own power, from the outer
anchorage, up the dredged channel, to the mooring dolphins
opposite Balboa, a distance of about 5 miles. Balboa is the
name of a new town built by the Americans on the Eastern bank
of the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal. The ground on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>which it is situated is not flat, also there are a couple of isolated
volcanic cones, that rise to a height of 363 feet and 650 feet
respectively, in its midst. A fine sanitary city has been designed,
and largely brought into being, and as the work of construction
of the Canal proceeds towards completion, for there is still much
work to be done, so everything connected with the Canal will be
concentrated there. To this new town of Balboa adjoins the
old city of Panama, the capital of the Republic of Panama, but
now isolated from the rest of the republic, being entirely surrounded
by U.S.A. territory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we go through the Canal, it will be well to have a
general idea of its character. Let us first consider that of the
Suez. The Isthmus of Suez is a level neck of sand, only slightly
raised above sea level. Across it a gutter has been dug: the
Mediterranean Sea, unobstructed, flows along that gutter, until
it blends its waters with those of the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Panama is an entirely different proposition. The Isthmus
of Panama is a neck of land formed of volcanic debris and rock.
It is only partially level; it is humped in the middle, but that
hump is hollowed like a saucer. So we have this sequence:—A
level. A hump. A level.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Canal therefore is made in this way. Firstly the middle,
or humped part, is changed, by means of embankments, from a
semi-dry saucer into a deep high-level pond, <em>i.e.</em> into a pond
whose surface is 85 feet above the level of the sea. That pond
is filled, and kept filled, with sweet water by the rainfall on high
country around it—the inner slope of the edge of the saucer.
As we are only concerned with two embankments which go to
form the pond, we will refer to one as the Eastern and to the
other as the Western.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next, the Pacific Ocean is brought up a distance of about
4 miles, to the foot of the Western Embankment, by digging a
simple gutter through level country, just as has been done in
the case of Suez: similarly the Atlantic is brought a distance
of about 5 miles to the foot of the Eastern Embankment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, each embankment is equipped with a series of water
steps, or locks, whereby a vessel is lifted up from the ditch into
the pond, or lowered from the pond into the ditch. Water of
the pond, in measured doses of a lockful at a time, and on
which dose float one or more ships, is first shut off from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>pond, and is then permitted gently to escape into the Pacific
Ocean ditch, or into the Atlantic Ocean ditch, as the case
may be.</p>

<p class='c007'>No drop of Atlantic sea water ever mingles with the
sweet water of the Central Pond. No drop of Pacific sea
water ever mingles with the sweet water of the Central Pond.
The Atlantic with the Pacific do not commingle directly or
indirectly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Punctually at 7 a.m. the Canal pilot boarded us, and we left
Balboa 7.35 a.m. under our own power, and proceeded up the
Canal. It was a real pleasure trip. Engines running to perfection.
Pilot most complimentary to them. No navigating
to be done. The men highly content at the information that,
once through the lock gates, the ship would be in fresh water,
and they could wash clothes all day long. Largesse of soap
distributed. We reached the Miraflores Locks at 8.15 a.m.
Distance from Balboa about 2 miles. The shores of the Canal
between Balboa and Miraflores present little of interest—the
Canal is here simply a ditch cut through a swamp. We enter
the lower lock: the water of the pond above our heads is let in,
and we rise about 54 feet. The doors in front of us open, and we
pass out into a pool. From this pool we enter a second lock:
we again rise about 31 feet: the gates in front of us open,
and we are floating in an arm of the artificially formed Gatun
Lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>This lake or pond or saucer is of considerable extent: about
⅓ the size of the Isle of Wight. Here it is deep: there it is
shallow. What were marshes, when it was still unflooded, have
now become its deeps: what were hillock or hill-tops now appear
as isolated islands. It is between such islands that the ship
channel threads.</p>

<p class='c007'>A remarkable feature is that the islands, each of which was
lately a hill-top, have as yet no horizontally cut shore or strand:
the slope of the hillside is the same below the surface of the
water as above it: the waves have not yet cut a shore bench
or shelf. The trees therefore stand immersed in varying degree,
some with the foot of the trunk only just awash: others with
their topmost boughs only just showing. Where the bottom of
the pond is level, large areas of now dead, but still standing,
forest trees, partially submerged to an even depth, present a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>remarkable, because a transient, feature. Presently these will
decay and disappear, then the water surface of the pond will
appear to be greater than it does to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 10.10 a.m. we passed out of the Western (Miraflores and
Miguel) locks, and proceeded across the pond, and reached the
other side—the entrance to the Eastern Locks (the Gatun
Locks)—at 4.51 p.m. Here we moored ship, as the Canal people
would not drop us from the pond into the Atlantic ditch that
night. We observed that the U.S.A. were not taking any risks
that they could avoid of German agents causing trouble: sentries
were posted everywhere, and no one from the ship was allowed
to wander about ashore. So <em>Mana’s</em> crowd sat in a row on
the edge of the lock, like migrating martins on a telegraph
wire, and swung their legs, in high good humour. Saturday,
March the 18th, at 8.7 a.m. we entered the Gatun Locks;
at 8.53 p.m. passed out; and at 10 a.m. came to anchor in
Colon Harbour.</p>

<p class='c007'>That afternoon we moored alongside a pier, and took aboard
coal, petroleum, and lubricating oil. The British Consul, Mr.
Murray, was most kind and hospitable, and though the flat mud
island on which Cristobal stands, and of which it occupies the
greater part, is unusually uninteresting, as is also the town, yet,
owing to Mr. Murray, we quite enjoyed a week’s detention there
that Fate had in store for us.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a vessel steams down the gutter (Gatun Approach) that
runs in a straight line from the Eastern Embankment (Gatun
Dam) into the Atlantic (Caribbean Sea), she has on her starboard
hand, as she approaches the termination of the gutter, a small
flat island of alluvium. The Canal water front of that island
is occupied now by wharves and jetties, behind which runs a
good road bordered with fairly respectable shops, and stores,
and drinking-dens. At one end is a large and good hotel; at
the other the stores, workshops, and residences of the Canal
Officials. To all this is given the name of CristObal—long O.
Immediately against Cristobal, and forming part of it, abuts the
town of COlon—another long O—a town that practically sprang
into being at the first making of the Canal: a twin sister to the
town of Suez of the olden days for vice and villainy. If Colon
be what it is now, with the U.S.A. in control, what must it have
been of yore? We believe that the Canal Administration allows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>the citizens of the Republic of Panama some sort of self government
as regards their town of Colon, hence its character. The
redeeming point about it is that it is so frequently and largely
burnt to the ground that it will eventually become quite reasonably
sanitary.</p>

<p class='c007'>At present, Cristobal is the executive centre on the Canal.
Here are all the workshops. Balboa, at the other end, is to-day
the administrative centre only, but gradually all interests connected
with the Canal will there be concentrated. To Cristobal
is brought, and from Cristobal is drawn, all labour and supplies.
All food consumed throughout the Canal zone—meat, fresh fish,
vegetables, fruit, is sent frozen from the U.S.A. and there kept
in cold storage—no supplies practically are derived from the
surrounding country. It is only by the courtesy of the Canal
Administration, that anyone, not in its employ, is allowed to
purchase food at its depots. Any foreigner therefore, whose
work requires him to live in the Canal zone, finds housekeeping
a very difficult matter. In our case, however, by the Regulations,
we were entitled to purchase what we wanted, but the same
Regulations specially state that any yacht, U.S.A. or foreign,
shall be charged 20 per cent. more than any other vessel for any
food supplied, or services rendered to her, and we were charged
accordingly. And this though the Administration had only
allowed us to pass through on the ground that we were not a
yacht. In no sense were we one. To an Englishman it seems
strange to find that another people considers it to the interest of
the State to differentiate against yachts: we know, in our case,
what our nation has gained by the widespread and intelligent
interest in maritime affairs, that is the outcome of the British
sport of yachting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having got all our essential stores aboard on the day of our
arrival (Saturday), we hoped to be able to get fresh provisions,
pay dues, and clear on the Monday. But now our troubles
began. There were at this time certain repairs that it was
desirable should be done to portions of our machinery. They
were not essential, as we had substituted new spares for each
defective part, but we thought it wise, as we were now at the
only port where we could get the work done, to get the damaged
parts renovated, so as to become spares in their turn. The
original idea was to send down the parts by boat, but eventually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>the machine shop desired the vessel to be laid alongside its
wharf. No vessel by the Regulations is allowed to be moved
without a Canal Pilot aboard her. He takes absolute command
and control. A pilot accordingly took her alongside all
right. Then arose delays—but everybody was most obliging,
and the work was well done, though of course prices were
very high.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime our kindly Consul was doing all he could to arrange
for us to have a day’s tarpon fishing from the Gatun Weir—from
hearsay it is most thrilling work: you stand on the great weir
with the water boiling in foam 85 feet beneath you and play
a real fighting fish of 100 to 200 lbs. weight. The gentleman
who was to have run us up to Gatun in his launch,
and to have helped us to get a fish, was, however, unavoidably
detained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day followed day with the vessel alongside the wharf and the
repair work in the workshops.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time we were much amused by an old Jamaican coloured
man, who spent most of the day sitting on the quay beside the
vessel close to her stern, where of course the ensign was flying
on the flagstaff. He, like all the British West Indian coloured
people, of whom there is a very large number at Cristobal-Colon,
was enthusiastically loyal, and told us, “I love to sit under de
ole flag: while you here, I do no more work—all de day I sit
under de ole flag.” The men took a fancy to him, and “de ole
flag” found something to spare for him at every meal, and a
pipe of baccy afterwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last the repairs were completed—shore accounts all settled
up and the Canal Pilot took charge to take us out. We had to
go out of the pool stern foremost. It turned out subsequently
that the Gatun Locks were at this time passing a vessel through.
This caused a current to flow past the pier head of the dock.
The pilot did not know of it, with the result that <em>Mana’s</em> stern
crashed into the pier head. Luckily the piling was very old and
rotten, and <em>Mana</em> extraordinarily strong, so that, though the
pier head structure was pretty considerably smashed, our own
damage was confined to broken taffrail stanchions and the ironwork
of the main gallows. We had therefore to return to our
berth and have this new lot of damage made good. The Pilot,
a Greek, of course tried to make out that the reversing gear had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>refused duty when he wanted to handle her, but, before we
could find the Captain of the Port, that official had already been
aboard and tried the engine, and told us that he found it worked
to perfection, and gave us the true cause of the accident. We
then asked him to give orders that our damage should be made
good by the Canal Administration free of charge, but this he
assured us was impossible under the Regulations—we must pay,
but the job should be expedited. He also, out of sympathy with
our misfortunes, gave us permission, when our job was done,
this time to take our ship out ourselves without having another
Canal pilot aboard, lest something worse should happen. And
this we eventually did, to our own great satisfaction. Before
however we could get our clearance, we had to deposit a sum
equal to double the estimated cost of our repairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Canal Administration, like the British Post Office, always
plays pitch and toss on the terms of “heads I win, tails you
lose.” It, very properly, compels you to take a pilot. It gives
him absolute power, and requires that he himself shall take
command and handle the vessel. But such a man’s experience
is confined to big steamers: with them he is probably quite
skilful, but give him a small craft or a yacht, and he knows as
much about handling her as he does of piloting an aeroplane.
Hence those tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing is equally true of the Suez Canal pilots. The
risks to a small craft in the passage of the ship canals are great,
and are solely due to the pilots being permitted to attempt to
handle them.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the Regulations of the Panama Canal stand, the Pilot may
be mad, or drunk, or incompetent, and elect to ram another
vessel, or to butt at a lock gate, nevertheless all damage done
to the ship, or by the ship, must be paid by the Owners of the
ship, before she is allowed to leave the Canal. Under no circumstances
will the Administration accept responsibility for
the conduct of their pilots. And there you have it.</p>

<p class='c007'>At 9.15 a.m. Sunday, March the 26th, 1916, we passed through
the breakwater into the Caribbean Sea. We had cleared from
Cristobal-Colon for Trinidad, one of our West Indian Islands,
but when doing so we never had any intention of going there.
We informed the British Consul of our reasons and had his
sanction. German sympathisers seemed to take a most kindly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>interest in us. We were really bound for Bermuda, via the
Windward Passage, which is the pass between the two great
islands of Cuba and St. Domingo. A strong wind and current
sweep at this time of year from East to West the length of the
Caribbean Sea, consequently we had to get well to the east’ard
so as to make sure of carrying a fair wind and current for rounding
Cape Tiburon, the western extremity of the Island of St. Domingo.
We therefore at once set to work to beat steadily to wind’ard
along the Venezuelan coast, keeping close in with the land, in
order to cheat the current and to have as little sea as possible.
As this coast is only roughly surveyed, and the lighting cannot
be depended on, we exercised special care when standing-in to
the land. We saw no craft along this coast except that, one
night, what looked like a small tramp steamer of about 800 tons
entirely changed her course, and bore down on us until she was
close alongside. She did not attempt to communicate. We
kept our course and took no notice of her. After a good look at
us she took herself off.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had unfortunately lost, at Cristobal, our excellent and
popular Japanese cook, and the coloured Panama man who
replaced him proved, after being given some days of grace, such
a miserable impostor that even the strenuous and varied educational
efforts of the fo’c’s’le failed to bring about his regeneration.
We heard, indirectly, that the Russian Finn decided that
it was a case of demoniacal possession and had attempted to cure
it by means of a course of massage of the windpipe. Others of
the crew suddenly became afflicted with a variety of complaints
for which they drew various drastic drugs from the ship’s medicine
chest and then, with great self-sacrifice, refraining from taking
these themselves, administered them instead to the chef. We
aft got along quite comfortably, as the cabin steward, Edwin
Young, belonging to Pitcairn Island, had become, since joining,
quite a good cook, and was most willing and hard working.
But the fo’c’s’le very naturally complained, so, in its interest,
we decided to alter our course and make for Port Royal, Jamaica,
to seek that pearl of price—a good sea cook.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing calling for remark occurred on this run until the 6th of
April. At 6.15 a.m. on that day Mr. Gillam, whose watch it was,
came below and said, “I wish you would come on deck, Sir; there’s
a water-spout bearing down on us.” In half a shake of a lamb’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>tail we were on deck, and a truly wonderful and impressive
sight presented itself. Away on our starboard bow was a vast,
dark purple cloud mass shaped like an open umbrella, or rather
like a vaulted roof with central pendant. The upper surface
of the dome blended with the normal clouds. The edge of
the dome was sharply defined, and from it small fragments of
cloud, all ragged, and looking like pearl-grey silk muslin torn
off and crumpled, kept breaking away to be left behind. The
dome-shaped mass, on its lower aspect, gradually became columnar,
the column extended downward until it almost, but not
quite, reached the sea. The lower part of its length was much
attenuated, and convoluted, and terminated in ragged mist,
and could be seen to be rotating rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The surface of the sea beneath it, over an area of perhaps a
mile in diameter, presented the appearance of a fiercely boiling
cauldron. The water rose up as waves of pyramidal form, from
which the wind tore off the apices, and whipped the same into
spume. The waves had no fixed direction: they simply dashed
into one another. Immediately beneath the ragged termination
of the central column the surface of the sea seemed to be bodily
lifted up, amidst a welter of mist, and froth, and spray, into a
cone-shaped form, but, between the apex of this cone, and the
rapidly rotating extremity of the column of cloud above it, there
always remained a distinct interval of considerable extent, that
had the appearance of dense mist: the appearance of a hard
rain-squall, seen from afar, as it sweeps over the sea. The
cloud came down towards the sea, and the sea rose up towards
the cloud, and there was an interval betwixt the two. The
column was not quite vertical: though it maintained perfect
continuity with the cloud mass above, of which it formed a part,
nevertheless its lower extremity tended somewhat to trail or
lag behind. It moved along its path towards us, quite slowly
and steadily, cutting our wake, at an acute angle, some miles
astern. It is difficult to conjecture what would happen to a
small craft, or to any craft, that found itself well within the area
of disturbance. Apart from anything else, the seas, tumbling
down on to the top of her from all quarters, even if they did not
break in her decks, could hardly fail to strip her hatch openings.
As we watched, we agreed that even <em>Mana</em> could scarcely be
expected to live amidst such seas, and therefore, obviously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>nothing could. As it was, the surface of the sea, where we were,
was little affected, nor was there any weight in the shifts of
wind as they occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>We then had breakfast and a pipe and settled down to routine
work when, at 10 a.m., a small cloud on the horizon, on our lee
bow, was observed to be behaving in a way opposed to the ordinary
laws of nature. Though a nice steady breeze was blowing
and no other clouds were to be seen anywhere else in this direction
on the horizon, yet this one particular patch, like a large sail,
remained constant in form and in the same position. As we
drew nearer, it was observed to increase and diminish in volume
from time to time. The only explanation we could think of was
that we had fallen in with a ship on fire, so we bore away towards
it. As we reduced the distance betwixt us and it, we gradually
made out that it was not one cloud of white smoke, but two
separate clouds, that arose, more or less alternately, at two
spots situated some two miles or so apart. Another point too
gradually developed. Each patch of cloud or smoke suddenly
burst forth to its maximum size and then gradually blew to
leeward, and dissipated. This led us to think that it must be
either gun practice or a naval action. The wind had now
fallen light, so we started our  engines, and made up our canvas,
and, like rats, headed for the scrimmage. It was suggested that,
following the classical example of Mr. Midshipman Easy a
ladies’ wardrobe aboard should be overhauled to find if possible
a green silk petticoat under which we might go into action. As
in Easy’s case, being unarmed, our approach was likely to be of
greater effect than our presence; but still we all decided to
make a claim for prize money. As we cut down the distance
it became evident that it could only be a matter of small craft,
for no hull could be made out. The fighting was taking place
on the northern side of Morant’s Cays, a group of low-lying coral
islets that lay between us and the combatants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation gradually developed. Morant’s Cays are coral
islets perched on the top of a volcanic area: there had been a
seismic disturbance of considerable extent: we had the large-scale
Admiralty plan of them. Great changes had taken place:
the sea was now breaking in various directions where deep water
was shown on the chart. At two points, from vents in the sea
bottom, steam was being ejected into the air in puffs, each puff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>forming a dense white cloud perhaps 200 or more feet high.
These puffs occurred some 1½ miles apart and one was much
larger than the other. The steam was ejected from each vent
alternately. We came in pretty close, but breaking water in
various directions warned us that we were looking for trouble,
so we headed away for Port Royal, Jamaica.</p>

    <div>Jamaica, and the Bahamas—Bermudas—Azores—Preparing for Submarines—Southampton once more.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c017'>JAMAICA</h4>

<p class='c018'>Jamaica was discovered by Columbus, and belonged to Spain till
1655, when it was captured by an expedition sent out by Oliver
Cromwell.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Island, from its proximity to the Spanish Possessions, was a
godsend to the Buccaneers. Port Royal, which, as its name shows,
was founded after the Restoration, was full of riches, often ill-gotten:
“always like a Continental mart or fair.” In 1692 it was overwhelmed
by an earthquake, and again laid low by fire in 1703.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kingston, originally begun as a settlement of refugees from Port
Royal after the earthquake, gradually grew in importance, and
finally became the capital of the island.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the wars which followed the French Revolution, Jamaica
was of importance as the great centre of British interests in the
Western Caribbean.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now headed for Jamaica; Kingston, its capital, lies towards
the eastern extremity of its southern coast. The town is placed
on flat land which gradually rises into dwarf hills. It is built
parallel to, and abutting on to its water-front. Right and left
of the city, when viewed from the sea, extends low country,
whilst behind it, and to the east, rises in the distance a lofty
range of mountains. From the open sea, the town and flat
country is divided by a natural breakwater that maintains the
general trend of the coast. By this breakwater is formed a
lagoon that runs East and West, parallel to the coast, for a
distance of some six miles, with an average breadth of about one
mile, and has practically no arms or branches. This lagoon is
the harbour of Kingston and a fine one, but it lacks the element
of picturesqueness, nor is it a comfortable one for small craft.
The strong easterly wind, known as “The Undertaker,” that
daily arises and increases in strength with the sun, sweeps down
its length and knocks up a nasty sea. It is difficult to obtain
shelter, even for a dinghy, when landing at Kingston.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>But we are anticipating. We ran down the coast, close in,
and at 9.30 a.m., Friday, April the 7th, 1916, we reached the
western end of the natural breakwater between which and the
mainland is the passage into the lagoon. Here the Port Doctor
came on board, and as he went through our bills of health we
mutually discovered that we were old hospital friends, though
we had never heard of each other for twenty years.</p>

<p class='c007'>We entered the harbour, and brought up in 15 fms., abreast
of the wharf of the old naval dockyard of Port Royal, and distant
from it about a cable’s length. Port Royal is situated on the
inner aspect of the bulbous-headed western extremity of the
natural breakwater. The land surface is very limited in extent
and is entirely taken up with the old fort, the old dockyard, and
old naval and military quarters. All but a few poor closely
packed houses is in the occupation of Government. The width
of the breakwater to the eastward soon becomes small; open
beach on seaward side, mangroves extending into the lagoon on
the other; and between the two sand and scrub. This part is
the well-known Palisadoes, the home of land-crabs and dead
men, and the scene of many a duel. Port Royal is now deserted;
no shipping or living workshops; everything is hushed, but the
place is not neglected. Nelson might have left it but yesterday;
the dockyard, with its fittings, stores, and quays, reminded one
of that other quaint little marine gem, the old naval dockyard
of English Harbour in the island of Antigua. When the place
hummed with life, <em>The Young Sea Officer’s Sheet Anchor</em>, by
Falconer, was the text book to work by, and its social life is
vividly and accurately given us by Marryat in one of his
novels.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in the dusk, all alone, we passed down the silent corridors,
and approached the old mess-room, we somehow listened for,
and expected at any moment to hear, through some opening
door, the reckless toast of “A bloody war, and a sickly season,”
the chink of glasses, and the crash of the chorus “Yellow Jack!
Yellow Jack!” And Jack, thus bidden, used to come, and
link his arm in that of some fine young fellow, and together the
two would saunter away “to the home of a friend of his in the
Palisadoes.” Little time for packing up allowed! Many and
many a man, in the prime of life and feeling quite well, has
dined at mess one night in snowy uniform: the next night in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>a white uniform of a different cut as the guest of Jack and Death.
These two kept open house in those days.</p>

<p class='c007'>The R.E. Officer in charge was most kind and hospitable;
he took us over the old fort, pointing out, amongst much else,
Nelson’s former quarters and the adjoining length of parapet
overlooking the harbour entrance, now known as Nelson’s Walk.
Our host informed us that, fishing from the wharves, he got
splendid sport.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Port Royal to Kingston is about four miles by the boat
channel. Passes through the coral banks have been blasted
where requisite and the channel beaconed. A least depth of
4½ ft. is thus obtained, and a direct course. Our little motor
lifeboat carried us backwards and forwards most excellently on
various voyages made to attend to our business at Kingston.
The way in which she bucked at speed over the short steep seas
reminded one of larking over hurdles on a pony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work in hand was to get our clearance inwards, to get rid
of our food-destroyer from Panama, and to find in his place a
live ship’s cook, to report particulars of the Morant’s Cays
upheaval, and finally the usual catering, and bill of health, and
clearance outwards. The Chief of the Customs was good enough
to interest himself in <em>Mana’s</em> welfare, so that all these matters
were dealt with in due sequence, and with the least possible
trouble to us. A coloured cook was procured from an hotel at
£16 a month, with, as it proved, but little justification on the
ground of ability for drawing such a rate of pay; still, his professional
enormities were associated with so many humorous
incidents, and as he appeared at least to mean well, we resigned
ourselves to the inevitable, and prayed that we might survive
his ministrations.</p>

<p class='c007'>About noon on Sunday, April 9, 1916, we weighed and
motored out from Port Royal, unplagued by pilots, and dipping
our ensign to the Port Doctor and his wife, in acknowledgment
of adieux waved from their garden. Clear of everything, the
engines were stopped and <em>Mana</em>, bound to “the stormy Bermuthies,”
proceeded to argue the point with a head wind as to
whether she should, or should not, go to windward. By steady
hammering she gradually got under the western end of the
Island of San Domingo, and then through the celebrated Windward
Passage. We had now to threadle our way betwixt the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>numerous islets that constitute the Bahama group, and it was
quite delightful and interesting; brilliant sunshine, cool moderate
breezes, land every few hours, but reliable charts. This was
yachting; we had met a good deal of what bore little semblance
to it, so we appreciated our present luck all the more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morning of the 19th of April 1916 saw us beating up under
the lee of Acklin Island and of Crooked Island; a fresh N.E.
breeze swept in puffs across the long, narrow, flat land. An
open native boat, with jib-headed mainsail as usual, was seen
heading across our course when we were close in, so we gave
her a wave, and, as we came into the wind, she rounded-to
under our stern, dousing her sail, unshipping her mast and
shooting up alongside our quarter. We dropped into her; a
couple of empty sacks were pitched in, and she was clear of
the ship before she had lost her way. The mast is stepped, the
sail hoisted, and she is off again with her gunnel steadily kept
awash. We now for the first time spoke. The two coloured
men, her crew, were most obliging; they would make for the
most convenient landing and then they would accompany us
catering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everything went off excellently; we made a tour to different
cottages and gardens, collecting whatever was available, particularly
grape-fruit, oranges, and tamarinds. We also got exceptionally
fine specimens of the shell of the King conch and of
the Queen conch. Hundreds of the King conch were piled up
at one spot on the shore ready to be burnt into lime.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natives appeared to be pure-blooded negroes of west-coast
type, and in some respects their culture remains unchanged.
For instance, the pestle and mortar and winnowing tray for
treating maize were exactly similar in pattern to those we had
seen used by the Akikuyu of Eastern Central Africa.</p>

<p class='c007'>When catering, the price of each article is settled by negotiation,
and it is definitely bought, as it is met with from time to
time in our perambulation, on condition that it shall be paid for
as it is passed into the boat on departure—cash on delivery.
Much other stuff, though unbought, is also brought down to the
boat in the hope of sale at the last moment. This too is generally
taken as well, because going cheaply, and also to avoid causing
disappointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everybody having been paid, and the already laden boat now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>pretty well cluttered-up with an unexpected additional cargo
of chickens, eggs, fruit, shells, and sundry ethnological acquisitions,
up goes the shoulder-of-mutton, the helmsman ships his
twiddling-stick, and, in a few moments, the water is purring
beneath our lee gunnel as the little craft slithers through the
closely set wavelets of land-sheltered water. Long, narrow, and
ballasted, these boats are very fast and are given the last ounce
of wind pressure they can stand up to. It seemed to us, however,
that her crew wished to show what they could do with
her as, halliard and sheet in hand, they lifted the lee gunnel from
moment to moment, just sufficiently to prevent her filling, but
they did so with an easy nonchalance that told that they were
finished boat sailors.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very few minutes saw us “once more aboard the lugger.”
We had left <em>Mana</em> at noon, and eight bells were striking as the
staysail-sheet-tackle scraped to leu’ard along the hairless belly
of its horse; we had explored an island, seen a good deal of its
people and their culture, and had revictualled ship, all within
four hours, yet without hurry!</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards sundown we passed out into the Atlantic, through
the Crooked Island Passage; at 8.45 p.m. the Light that marks
the Passage dipped over our taffrail, and we turned in with that
peace of mind which is the portion of those whose ship is clear
of all land.</p>

<p class='c007'>This day, April the 19th, Gibb’s Hill Lighthouse, Bermuda,
bore N. 42° E., distant 767 miles; it took us eleven days to do it.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>April the 20th.</em>—The sargasso weed formed floating islands
sometimes many acres in extent; when one considers the marine
fauna that centres round a piece of floating wreckage in tropical
seas, some idea can be formed of the wealth of life associated
with this vast sudd. Our patent log could no longer be towed.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>BERMUDAS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The Bermudas are a group of a hundred islands, most of which
are, however, bare rocks. They were discovered in the beginning
of the 16th century by Juan Bermudez, a Spaniard.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1609 attention was drawn to them by Sir George Somers, who
was shipwrecked there on his way to Virginia, and found them
“the most plentiful place that ever I came to for fish, hogs and
fowl.” Fifty emigrants were sent out in 1612. Moore, a ship’s
carpenter, was the first governor. He established his headquarters
at St. George’s. Later a more central position was needed, and
the town of Hamilton was laid out, and became the capital in
1815. The American War brought the islands into notice from a
naval point of view, and in 1810 a dockyard was begun on Ireland
Island, thousands of convicts being sent out from England for its
construction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible
government.</p>

<p class='c007'>We made Bermuda for the sake of gaining our northing. We
had new canvas awaiting us there, that we ought to have
received at Tahiti, and we had to decide, on cable advices, whether
we would lay up <em>Mana</em> here in Bermuda, in the United States
of North America, or bring her back to England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sailing Directions offered us two harbours, St. George’s
and Hamilton. They do not point out that all shipping business,
practically all business, is done at Hamilton. We selected
St. George’s. The harbour master came aboard with the pilot,
and proved an interesting man, kindly and obliging—an old
soldier, a keen conchologist, and a bit of a geologist. The
harbour itself is excellent and charming; it extends away <i><span lang="la">ad
infinitum</span></i> amongst the islets and coral patches, but there is little
indication of its being made much use of by mercantile shipping.</p>

<p class='c007'>St. George’s Island is linked to its big neighbour by causeways
and bridges, which are carried across the shallow coral sea. Its
quaint, clean, sleepy little townlet, or village, exists by letting
lodgings to American visitors, and growing early vegetables for
exportation to the States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The American Tourist is the winter migrant whose nature and
idiosyncrasies are by the islanders most deeply studied. He,
to the Bermudian, is Heaven’s choicest gift—his coconut—the
all-sufficing. Nine-tenths of the brain power of the islanders
is devoted to inducing the creature to visit the islands and to
keeping it contented whilst it is there, the other tenth to supplying
it with early vegetables in its continental habitat. Of course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>Bermuda is an important naval station, and a certain amount
of business is done in purveying to the naval and military establishments,
but that is a thing apart. The Dockyard is situated
on islands well removed from both St. George’s and Hamilton.
In this we may see the finger of Providence; placed elsewhere
it would have incommoded the American Tourist.</p>

<p class='c007'>This cult of the foreigner is the explanation of many things
which at first sight appear strange in Bermuda. It is about
eleven miles by road from St. George’s to Hamilton, and there
is no means of public conveyance beyond a covered pair-horse
wagonette, that acts as a carrier’s cart for goods and passengers.
We marvelled exceedingly why this should be, whereupon it
was thus explained to us by our butcher, who was also the
proprietor of the shandy-ran express aforesaid, and of a hired-carriage
business, and by his son and partner, the M.P. for the
St. George’s Harbour Division. The Americans find the climate
of Bermuda delightful as a winter resort. At Hamilton monster
hotels are built for them, but there is nothing whatever for them
to do. The islands do not possess any features of natural or
historical interest that appeal to tourists. Now the islanders
had observed that the dominant note in the American character
was its restlessness; unless an American could violently rush
around and spend money he was wretched and pined. But the
island had excellent roads and lovely views, so they provided
carriages, and objectives to drive to associated with romance
and story, the evolution of which, from a basis of nothing, is a
standing testimony to their intellectual creative powers, and
of the truth of the axiom that a demand creates a supply.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the island, for we may ignore the numerous islets, is very
small. With care and good management, and by severely
rationing him in the extent of his daily shay excursions, it was
found that the American could be kept alive, and healthy, and
cheerful for 14 days: from one steamer to the next: all this
time he exuded dollars. “All is well,” as the ant said to the
aphis. Then suddenly the heavens fell. A lewd spirit had
prompted our friend the butcher of St. George’s to import two
motor-buses and with them run an hourly service between Port
St. George and Hamilton, to the great convenience of the public,
and to his own exceeding profit. As if this were not enough, he
and others were known to have even placed orders in the States
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>for motor-cars! Bitter was the cry of the carriage purveyors
of Hamilton, of the hotels, of the furnished apartments. The
American visitor would “do the darned island,” every inch of
its roads, twice over, in a single day, and get away by the same
boat he had arrived by—(the boats stay two days loading
vegetables).</p>

<p class='c007'>But where shall salvation be found if not in “government of
the people, by the people, for the people”? Many members of
both Houses indirectly, and in some cases directly, were interested
in the hired carriage, or apartment, or hotel lines. Trained
in such schools for statesmen, the Legislature was able to visualise
the national danger, and deal with it broadly, regardless of the
vested interests of the day. Without delay both Houses met,
an Act was passed, and the Royal Assent given through the
Governor, whereby the butcher was given the cost price of his
two buses, and a solatium; the buses were immediately to be
sent back to the States, and, for the future, no form of automobile
was to be landed, owned, or used on the island. Heavy
penalties for infraction. So there is still one spot on earth,
anyhow, where one can escape the scourge of the motor-horn.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a few days we stayed at St. George’s, getting a little
smith’s work done and watering ship. There is no surface
water on the island; the rain water is collected and stored in
great underground cisterns hewn in the solid coral rock of which
the island is formed. The water-supply thus conserved has
never been known to fail. In <em>Mana’s</em> case the Military Authorities
kindly sent their large tank-boat alongside. At odd times
we explored in the launch some of the labyrinth of waterways
and islets forming part of St. George’s Harbour, or connected
with it. When doing so one afternoon, we made the acquaintance,
at nightfall, of a coloured fisherman, by offering him the
courtesy of a pluck home. This man (Bartram of St. George’s)
proved an extraordinarily good fellow. He said he never worked
on Sundays, therefore he was free to offer to take us on that
day, as his guest, to try for monsters in a certain wonderful hole,
far out on the edge of the reef, a spot we could reach with the
aid of our launch. He was most keen about it, so we accepted.
The monster-capturing was a failure, but he and his two sons
worked hard all day, and seemed much concerned that they
had failed to show sport, nor would they consider any suggestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>of payment for their long day’s work, on our return to the ship.
They accepted, however, a clasp-knife each, as a souvenir of our
excursion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bartram had told us that he had at home a wonderfully fine
and rare “marine specimen.” (The collection of “marine
specimens” is one of the refuges of despair of the American
Tourist, and their supply has gradually become a minor industry
of Bermuda.) He had found it some years ago. Many millionaires
from the hotels or on yachts had offered him big prices
for it, but the very fact that they were so keen to get it had
made him all the more determined to keep it. Some day he
had intended to sell it. Now would we accept it as a gift? On
inspection it proved to be no coral, but a very fine example of
a colony of sociable sea snails (Vermetus). We therefore suggested
to Bartram that we should take it to England on <em>Mana</em>
and offer it in his name as a gift to the British Museum (Natural
History). This we did, and Dr. Harmer, the Keeper of the
Zoological Department, was much pleased with it, and wrote to
Bartram accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interest of this little story lies in the fact of its being a
typical example of the way in which one often finds, in our
remote dependencies, the people exhibiting unexpected keenness
and pride in associating themselves with England, and her
interests, on an opportunity of doing so being pointed out to
them. We had found it so at Pitcairn Island.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more delightful place than Bermuda at which to spend a
winter would be hard to find by those who care for pleasure
sailing in smooth waters, fishing, sunshine, and the customary
amenities of civilised life. Unhappily we could not spare the
time to avail ourselves of the possibilities of St. George’s. We
had constantly to be at Hamilton on ship’s business, so after
several journeys to and fro in the dreadful covered wagonette,
wherein physical discomfort almost rendered us indifferent to
a kaleidoscopic succession of humorous persons, situations, and
incidents, we got a pilot and went round under power into
Hamilton Harbour. Pilotage is compulsory, but free. Once at
Hamilton things went much more easily. The Colonial Authorities
and the Admiral in Command and his Staff were most kind
and hospitable. Admiralty House is a charming eighteenth-century
English country residence, of moderate size, and romantically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>situated. In its garden, peeps of the sea are seen,
through graceful subtropical foliage, at every turn, and miniature
land-locked coves, reached from above by winding steps down
the face of the falaise, afford the most perfect of boat harbours
and bathing-pools.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another delightful official residence is allotted to the officer
in command of the Dockyard. In his case he is given a miniature
archipelago. His tiny islands rise from 20 to 100 feet above
the water. On one is his house; another is his garden; chickens
and pigs occupy a third, whilst his milch goats live on various
small skerries. As the extent of water between the different
islets is proportional to their size, and is deep, the whole makes
a very charming and compact picture. Yet he is only ten
minutes by bicycle from his office in the Dockyard, although,
from his little kingdom, no sign of the Dockyard is to be seen,
it being shut off by a wooded promontory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Admiral was good enough to offer us every facility for
laying up <em>Mana</em> in the Dockyard, but on various grounds we
eventually decided to take war-time risks and bring her back
to England, so receiving from him a signal-rocket outfit, and
some kindly advice on the unwisdom of trying to run-down
periscopes that showed no wake behind them, the vessel being
now refreshed, at 0.55 p.m. on Friday, May the 12th, 1916, we
weighed, and proceeded under power from Hamilton to the
Examination Anchorage, with pilot aboard. Arriving there at
4.15 p.m. the Examining Officer came alongside and handed us
the now usual special Admiralty clearance card, together with
a courteous radiogram wishing us luck, from the Officer in
Command of the Dockyard. The new trysail was hoisted, the
engines stopped, and we commenced our voyage to Ponta Delgada
in the Island of St. Miguel, one of the Azores, distant miles 1,869.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>BERMUDA TO AZORES</h4>

<p class='c024'>This run was of “yachting” character. Gentle breezes,
smooth seas, an occasional sail on the horizon. On the eighth
day out, at the beginning of the first watch, the lights of St. Elmo
were seen burning on both fore and main trucks. It is rather
remarkable that this was the first, and only occasion, on which
this phenomenon occurred throughout the entire voyage. Occasionally
we got a turtle. Ten o’clock in the morning of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>30th of May showed us the Peak of Pico Island, 65 miles away,
and at 10 p.m. next day, Thurs., May the 31st, we hove to off
Ponta Delgada in the island of St. Miguel to await daylight.
The 1,869 miles had taken us 18 days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having been the victims of the organised dishonesty of the
pilots of San Francisco in California, we had long before decided
to run no risks of having the vessel again detained for ransom
by foreign officials. <em>Mana</em> therefore next day, June the 1st, simply
stood in and dropped a boat outside the breakwater, and again
stood off, whilst we pulled in. Being Good Friday, it was, of
course, a <i><span lang="fr">fiesta</span></i>, all shops shut, and everybody away in the
country. Our consul, too, was away for the day, but his wife
kindly gave us our letters. We had been instructed to obtain
from him the necessary information regarding war conditions,
and the regulations governing shipping bound for British ports.
At Bermuda nothing was known.</p>

<p class='c007'>When pulling up the harbour, we had noticed one British
vessel—an armed Government transport, evidently formerly a
small German passenger-carrying tramp—so having bought
some pineapples, vegetables and cigarettes, nothing else being
procurable, we got into our boat and paid her a visit. Her
commander was ashore for the day with the Consul fiestaing,
but his Chief Officer was good enough to put us <i><span lang="fr">au courant</span></i> with
things, so we bade adieu to Ponta Delgada without any wish
to see more of it, and pulled out to sea. The ship was far away
to leeward, set down by wind and current. Not expecting us
to get through our work so quickly, she had not troubled to
keep her station, but went off to argufy by flag with a Lloyd’s
Signal-Station which would not admit that she was in its book.</p>

<p class='c007'>After she had picked us up one of the men left aboard asked
whether any of the craft in the harbour were “a-hanging Judas.”
Though there were several small square-rigged vessels alongside
the Mole, none had, however, cock-billed their yards.<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c016'><sup>[93]</sup></a> It was
interesting thus to find that the memory and meaning of the old
sea custom still survived. Old superstitions and fancies still
exist: an ancient shellback who was with us down to the s’uth’ard
reprobated the capture of an albatross—“They is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>spurrits of drownded seamen.” Someone objected on doctrinal
grounds, but was met with the crushing rejoinder: “I said
<em>spurrits</em>: their <i><span lang="fr">souls</span></i> ar’ in ’ell.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'>AZORES TO SOUTHAMPTON</h4>

<p class='c024'>And now we come to the last lap. On June the 1st, by
1 p.m. we were again aboard <em>Mana</em>, the boat hoisted in, and
she bore away to round Ferraira Point which forms the extremity
of St. Michael’s Island. From Ferraira’s Point to the haven
where we would be was 1101.5 miles, and the direction N.49¼° E.
true, or, shall we say, North East.</p>

<p class='c007'>After making the customary routine entries in the Log Book
associated with taking departure—the latitude, the longitude,
the reading of the patent log, the canvas set, etc.—our Sailing-master
makes the following entry, “And now we are fairly on
our way to Dear Old Britain. All the talk now is of the submarine
risks. I put our chances of getting through unmolested
at 85 per cent. But is the <em>Mana</em> doomed? Time will tell,
but I don’t think.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless every preparation was now made, in case we had
to leave the ship in a hurry, at the orders of some German submarine.
The engine was taken out of the lifeboat to save
weight. Every detail both for her and the cutter was suitably
packed or made up, and placed in the deck-house, ready to be
passed into her at the last moment before she was lowered.
We could only afford room for the photographic negatives and
papers of the Expedition. If the ship be sunk, the whole of the
priceless, because irreplaceable, archæological and ethnological
collections must go with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men, however, proceeded to pack, in their great seamen’s
bags, all the clutter and old rubbish they had accumulated
during a voyage of over three years. Its bulk and weight would
have rendered the boats unmanageable. Moreover, each man,
when the time came, would be attending to shipping his property
instead of giving all thought to getting his boat with her essential
equipment safely away from the vessel. But we had taken them
this long voyage without accident, and we were not going to let
them make fools of themselves at the finish. Moreover, <em>Mana</em>
carried a pretty mixed crowd: English, Spanish, Portuguese,
and West Indian negroes, a Russian Finn, and descendants of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>mutineers of the <em>Bounty</em>. At a pinch, amongst such a lot, long
knives are apt to appear from nowhere, and self-control and
discipline be at an end, with lamentable result. We therefore
drew up a set of orders in triplicate; one copy for the fo’c’s’le,
one for aft, and one for entry in the official log, in which was
clearly set out a routine that was to be followed to the letter
in the event of our having to take to the boats. The details need
not here be given, suffice to say that they stated that explicit
orders for the common good were now set out in writing, and
that THESE ORDERS WOULD NOT, WHEN THE OCCASION
AROSE, BE REPEATED VERBALLY; that there was ample
boat accommodation for all, if the lifeboat were got away safely
from the ship before the cutter, but not otherwise, because all
hands were needed to swing out the larger boat. Therefore,
when the ship’s bell rang, the Sailing-master would take up his
position by the lifeboat in the waist, to superintend her launching
and stowage, and to give orders, and eventually to take command
of her, and the Master would pick up his loaded repeating rifle
and spare cartridges in clips and go to the taffrail. (It was
obvious from that position he could see and hear everything,
and yet could not be approached or rushed by any, or many.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Any man failing immediately to appear on deck when the bell
rang would be shot dead without any warning when he did
appear. Any man endeavouring to place his private gear in a
boat would be shot dead in the act, without any warning. The
like if he attempted to enter other than his own boat, or his own
boat out of his turn. The like on a long knife, or other weapon,
being seen in his hand or possession. The like on his failing to
obey the verbal orders as issued.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the routine laid down the lifeboat would get away safely
with her crew and equipment. The cutter’s own crew were
strong enough to load and lower their own boat, after having
assisted the heavy lifeboat, provided they obeyed the orders of
the Mate who had charge of her. He was a good seaman, but
it was essential that he should have the moral support that
comes from a loaded rifle. Once boats all clear and safe, the
lifeboat would pull in to the ship, as close as she thought wise,
whereupon the “Old Man,” in a nice cork jacket, would drop
off his taffrail into the water, and she would pick him up.</p>

<p class='c007'>These orders and the penalties, extreme as they were, met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>with general approval as far as we could gather indirectly. Two
days after their being posted, when Thomas, the coloured cook,
came for orders, we thought we would put him through his
catechism. “Have you learnt up the orders in the fo’c’s’le
that concern you, Thomas?” “Yes, sar!” “When the bell
rings, what will <em>you</em> do?” “Jump deck quick, damn quick,
sar!” “Good! And then?” “I go starn big boat.” “And
when she is in the water you’ll jump into her?” “No, sar!
You shoot Thomas. Cutter’s my boat.” Thomas had got up
his orders thoroughly and intelligently, and departed quite
pleased with his viva voce exam., and the bundle of cigarettes
his reward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the men, finding that their kit-bags must be left
behind, hit out the following ingenious plan for saving their
clothes. They first put on their Sunday best suit, over that
their weekday go-ashore rig, then their working clothes. To
the foregoing must be added a knitted guernsey or two, and any
superior underclothing. The result was most grotesque; they
could hardly waddle, or get through the fo’c’s’le hatch. Had
the fine weather continued, their sufferings would have been
severe. A gale, however, in which no submarine could show
her nose, came to their rescue.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time we are writing of—June 1916—the submarines
were not operating far out into the Atlantic. Our idea was to
keep <em>Mana</em> well away until we got on to about the same parallel
of latitude as the Scilly Isles, and then wait thereabouts until
it blew hard from the S.W. Blow it did, sure enough, with
high confused seas: dangerous. Gradually they became bigger,
but less wicked. We rode it out dry and comfortably as usual,
with oil bags to wind’ard. Unhappily it was an Easterly gale,
instead of the Westerly we had hoped for. It moderated. The
wind drew to the Nor’ard. We let her go, and sped up the
Channel at a great pace, and arrived in St. Helen’s Roads, Isle
of Wight, at noon on June the 23rd. Twenty-two days from St.
Miguel. We had entered and passed up the English Channel,
unchallenged by friend or foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>In St. Helen’s Roads we took aboard the now obligatory
Government pilot, who brought us through the different defences
to the Hamble Spit Buoy, from which we had started three
years and four months earlier.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>We had traversed, almost entirely under canvas, without
accident of consequence to ship or man, a distance of over One
Hundred Thousand miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such is the mana of MANA.</p>

<p class='c008'>[The Royal Cruising Club Challenge Cup, last held by <em>Sunbeam</em> (Lord
Brassey), was, in 1917, awarded to <em>Mana</em> on her return, by special resolution
of the Annual General Meeting of the Club, “for a remarkable cruise
in the Pacific.”]</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>EPILOGUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><em>MANA</em> was once more back in England, and her crew went each
on his way. The Brixham and Lowestoft men returned to their
homes, having at least enlarged their knowledge of the world.
Rosa, the Chilean engineer, and the Jamaican cook disappeared
to get engagements back to their respective lands; Rosa, we
trust, to realise his dreams of a shop and a wife at St. Vincent.
Mr. Gillam applied for service in the Royal Navy, and subsequently
became a sub-lieutenant in the R.N.R.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two Pitcairners were the last left on board; they had
proved themselves very intelligent, as well as good workers.
Charles could, it is believed, have passed an examination on
every port he had visited, and how long he had stayed in each.
We endeavoured to make some amends for our lack of Mendelian
research on their island, by sending them up to the Royal College
of Surgeons, where they were thoroughly measured and examined
by Professor Keith.<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c016'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A still more signal honour awaited them; they were commanded
to Buckingham Palace as representatives of England’s
smallest colony. Mr. Gillam took charge of them in London.
He was not intimately acquainted with the great city, and used
the map as he would a chart, disdaining the main thoroughfares,
unless they lay on the direct route, and steering a straight
course by weird and mysterious alleys. Any way, his charges
were produced in good time at the Palace.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the arrangements for the interview, S. had stated that
the men spoke “the pure Elizabethan English of the Bible and
Prayer Book”; their vocabulary, however, had been enlarged
on <em>Mana</em>, and I was not without trepidation lest such expressions
might crop out as “I don’t mind if I do”; which is
considered at Brixham the most courteous form of polite acceptance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>All, however, went well. Charles, who acted as spokesman,
after a first embarrassment answered readily the questions
asked by the King. The Queen graciously accepted some
specimens of Pitcairn handiwork, and the men were much
impressed with the kindness and condescension of their
Majesties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Incidentally, during the interview with which we were previously
honoured, they made great friends with the royal footman
who was on duty outside. He was of course a very imposing
person in scarlet and gold, and they shook hands affectionately
with him on leaving. Cuttings from the newspapers of official
and other paragraphs, announcing the reception of the two
inhabitants of Pitcairn by King George and Queen Mary, were
taken back by them to be inserted in the State records of the
island. Posts were obtained for both men on a New Zealand
liner, and we have since heard that they have safely returned to
their home, having made the voyage from Tahiti on a little
schooner which the plucky Pitcairners have built since we were
there. It is to be hoped that this boat may continue a success
and solve many of the problems of the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>This narrative cannot close without that note of pride and
sadness which, alas, characterises so many records at this time
in the history of the world. Since the first chapter was written
two more of our company have laid down their lives. The
words of appreciation which it was hoped would have given
pleasure can only be wreaths to their memory. Charles Jeffery,
of Lowestoft, who joined at Whitstable and was with us to the
last, who grew from boyhood to manhood on <em>Mana</em>, has met
with a hero’s death on a minesweeper.</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry James Gillam rests in a Sicilian grave. Volunteers
were called for, for specially dangerous work in capturing submarines;
Gillam responded—it is impossible to picture his doing
otherwise—and he fell in action in April 1918. The loss to his
country is great; to us it is very real and personal. The whole
voyage of the <em>Mana</em> is a tribute to his skill. His high intelligence
and character secured him universal confidence, while his unvarying
good temper—in bad times as well as in good—made
him a delightful companion. One can only think of him in that
other life as still keen for some new work or enterprise, and
carrying it out with perfect loyalty and success.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>Thus from land and sea, in defence of a Great Cause, have
our comrades of the Expedition made their last voyage
“westward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And now the story is told. The Expedition has, we hope,
brought some new pieces to fit into the puzzle which it went
out to study, but the help is needed of every reader who has
more to bring, from whatever part of the world; so alone can
be finally solved the Mystery of Easter Island.</p>

Davis in 1687. It was, he said, five hundred miles from the coast of Chile,
low and sandy, and some twelve leagues to the west of it was seen “a
long tract of pretty high land.” The description in no way applies to
Easter, with which it has sometimes been identified. The probability seems
to be that Davis was out of his reckoning, as was by no means unusual
in the case of the early mariners, and it has been suggested that the island
he saw was Crescent Island, the high ground in the distance being the
Gambier group. The latitude of Easter Island is 27° 8′ S., that of Crescent

The signification of the others is not equally clear, and the natives could
give no assistance; but Mr. Ray gives the following interesting information
from other Polynesian sources. “Haumoana” means the sea-breeze;
“Hitiuira” is probably “hiti-ra” or sunrise; and “Ureohei” another
version of “ura-o-hehe,” or red of sundown. “Koro-orongo” is doubtless
from “Koro-o-Rongo,” or the ring of Rongo (a well-known Polynesian
deity), that is the rainbow. “Kotuu” appears to be a contraction of
“Ko Otuu,” meaning “The Hill”; the name “Otuu” is used alternatively
for the same district. “Hotu” is another form of the word for
hill and “Iti” signifies small, it presumably refers to Rano Raraku.</p>

consideration we came to the conclusion that it was a natural phenomenon

<p class='c007'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. Theosophists, indeed, contend that it has been revealed by occult
means that Easter Island is the remaining portion of an old continent
named “Lemuria,” which occupied the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and
the writer has been informed by correspondents that she “may be interested
to learn” that such is the case. Representations even of the world
at this remote epoch have been, it is said, received by clairvoyance and are
reproduced in theosophical literature: in the case of a later continent
of Atlantis, which has also disappeared, it was permitted to see its proportions
on a globe and by other means; but, unfortunately, in the case
of Lemuria, “there was only a broken terra-cotta model and crumpled map,
so that the difficulty of carrying back the remembrance of all the details,
and consequently of reproducing exact copies, has been far greater”
(<cite>The Lost Lemuria</cite>, Scott Elliot, p. 13). The world at the Lemurian epoch
was, we are informed, inhabited by beings who were travelling for the
fourth time through their round of the planets, and undergoing for the
third time their necessary seven incarnations on the earth during this
round. At the beginning of this third race of the fourth round, man first
evolved into a sexual being, and at the end was highly civilised. The
makers of the Easter Island statues were of gigantic size. To prove this
last point, Madame Blavatsky quotes a statement to the effect that
“there is no reason to believe that any of the statues have been built up
bit by bit,” and proceeds to argue that they must consequently have
been made by men of the same size as themselves. She states that “the
images at Ronororaka—the only ones now found erect—are four in
number”; and gives the following account of the head-dress of the
statues, “a kind of flat cap with a back piece attached to it to cover the
back portion of the head” (<cite>Secret Doctrine</cite>, vol. ii. p. 337). The readers
of this book can judge of the correctness of these descriptions. Theosophists
must forgive us, if, in the face of error as to what exists to-day, we
decline to accept without further proof information as to what occurred
“nearer four million than two million years ago.”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
